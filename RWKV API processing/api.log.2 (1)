### FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES (DO NOT ANSWER) ###

--- EXAMPLE 1 (DO NOT ANSWER) START ---
Passage:
Last week I talked with some of my students about what they wanted to do after they graduated, and what kind of job prospects  they thought they had.
Given that I teach students who are training to be doctors, I was surprised do find that most thought that they would not be able to get the jobs they wanted without "outside help". "What kind of help is that?" I asked, expecting them to tell me that they would need a   or family friend to help them out.
"Surgery ," one replied.
I was pretty alarmed by that response. It seems that the graduates of today are increasingly willing to go under the knife to get ahead of others when it comes to getting a job .
One girl told me that she was considering surgery to increase her height. "They break your legs, put in special extending screws, and slowly expand the gap between the two ends of the bone as it re-grows, you can get at least 5 cm taller!"
At that point, I was shocked. I am short, I can't deny that, but I don't think I would put myself through months of agony just to be a few centimetres taller. I don't even bother to wear shoes with thick soles, as I'm not trying to hide the fact that I am just not tall!
It seems to me that there is a trend towards wanting "perfection" , and that is an ideal that just does not exist in reality.
No one is born perfect, yet magazines, TV shows and movies present images of thin, tall, beautiful people as being the norm. Advertisements for slimming aids, beauty treatments and cosmetic surgery clinics fill the pages of newspapers, further creating an idea that "perfection" is a requirement, and that it must be purchased, no matter what the cost. In my opinion, skills, rather than appearance, should determine how successful a person is in his/her chosen career.

Question:
We can know from the passage that the author works as a_.

Options:
A: doctor
B: model
C: teacher
D: reporter

### REAL QUESTION — ANSWER THIS ONLY ###
Passage:
At one time, people used to travel to foreign countries because they thought they would be different from home--the building, the food, the national dress. Nowadays, however, one large city is very like another. They all have their Hilton or Sheraton Hotels which look Hilton or Sheraton Hotels everywhere. They all have their McDonald's, their KFCs, their Pizza Huts. Office buildings look the same everywhere, and most city centers are full of office buildings. And, of course, people are driving the same brands of Japanese or European cars, usually wearing the same kinds of clothing and the world's airlines are all flying the same aircraft, Boeings or Airbuses.
What, therefore, is the purpose of foreign travel for people who are not on business? What do tourists hope to experience in a foreign country that they cannot experience at home? Why travel to foreign countries at all? The answer could be that people are very interested in the past. It is a nation's history that is its main attraction. Most of today's tourists travel overseas to find out what foreign countries and cultures used to be like, not what they are like today. The words " _ " are now part of the language of tourism, and it is the museums and works of art in many countries that are their main attractions.
If they are lucky--and have had sensible, strong governments--many countries also usually have at least a few beautiful places for tourists to visit.
Finally there is perhaps a nation's greatest attraction: its people. A nation is not just its historical buildings, its works of art or beautiful places, it is also the people who live in it. This is why a country such as Thailand attracts millions of people every year. They come mainly because of the friendliness of the Thai people. It is why the Pacific Islands are also so popular. There may not be much to see or do in Fiji, but there are lots of friendly, smiling people to make visitors feel welcome.

Question:
The writer thinks that large cities in foreign countries  _  .

Options:
A: are similar to one another
B: share the same aircraft
C: do not have good hotels
D: do not offer a warm service to foreigners

### FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES (DO NOT ANSWER) ###

--- EXAMPLE 1 (DO NOT ANSWER) START ---
Passage:
Last week I talked with some of my students about what they wanted to do after they graduated, and what kind of job prospects  they thought they had.
Given that I teach students who are training to be doctors, I was surprised do find that most thought that they would not be able to get the jobs they wanted without "outside help". "What kind of help is that?" I asked, expecting them to tell me that they would need a   or family friend to help them out.
"Surgery ," one replied.
I was pretty alarmed by that response. It seems that the graduates of today are increasingly willing to go under the knife to get ahead of others when it comes to getting a job .
One girl told me that she was considering surgery to increase her height. "They break your legs, put in special extending screws, and slowly expand the gap between the two ends of the bone as it re-grows, you can get at least 5 cm taller!"
At that point, I was shocked. I am short, I can't deny that, but I don't think I would put myself through months of agony just to be a few centimetres taller. I don't even bother to wear shoes with thick soles, as I'm not trying to hide the fact that I am just not tall!
It seems to me that there is a trend towards wanting "perfection" , and that is an ideal that just does not exist in reality.
No one is born perfect, yet magazines, TV shows and movies present images of thin, tall, beautiful people as being the norm. Advertisements for slimming aids, beauty treatments and cosmetic surgery clinics fill the pages of newspapers, further creating an idea that "perfection" is a requirement, and that it must be purchased, no matter what the cost. In my opinion, skills, rather than appearance, should determine how successful a person is in his/her chosen career.

Passage:
Last week I talked with some of my students about what they wanted to do after they graduated, and what kind of job prospects  they thought they had.
Given that I teach students who are training to be doctors, I was surprised do find that most thought that they would not be able to get the jobs they wanted without "outside help". "What kind of help is that?" I asked, expecting them to tell me that they would need a   or family friend to help them out.
"Surgery ," one replied.

### REAL QUESTION — ANSWER THIS ONLY ###
Passage:
At one time, people used to travel to foreign countries because they thought they would be different from home--the building, the food, the national dress. Nowadays, however, one large city is very like another. They all have their Hilton or Sheraton Hotels which look Hilton or Sheraton Hotels everywhere. They all have their McDonald's, their KFCs, their Pizza Huts. Office buildings look the same everywhere, and most city centers are full of office buildings. And, of course, people are driving the same brands of Japanese or European cars, usually wearing the same kinds of clothing and the world's airlines are all flying the same aircraft, Boeings or Airbuses.
What, therefore, is the purpose of foreign travel for people who are not on business? What do tourists hope to experience in a foreign country that they cannot experience at home? Why travel to foreign countries at all? The answer could be that people are very interested in the past. It is a nation's history that is its main attraction. Most of today's tourists travel overseas to find out what foreign countries and cultures used to be like, not what they are like today. The words " _ " are now part of the language of tourism, and it is the museums and works of art in many countries that are their main attractions.
If they are lucky--and have had sensible, strong governments--many countries also usually have at least a few beautiful places for tourists to visit.
Finally there is perhaps a nation's greatest attraction: its people. A nation is not just its historical buildings, its works of art or beautiful places, it is also the people who live in it. This is why a country such as Thailand attracts millions of people every year. They come mainly because of the friendliness of the Thai people. It is why the Pacific Islands are also so popular. There may not be much to see or do in Fiji, but there are lots of friendly, smiling people to make visitors feel welcome.

Question:
The writer believes that many tourists are interested in foreign  _  .

Options:
A: hotels
B: history
C: cars
D: programs

Passage:
Last week I talked with some of my students about what they wanted to do after they graduated, and what kind of job prospects  they thought they had.
Given that I teach students who are training to be doctors, I was surprised do find that most thought that they would not be able to get the jobs they wanted without "outside help". "What kind of help is that?" I asked, expecting them to tell me that they would need a   or family friend to help them out.
"Surgery ," one replied.
I was pretty alarmed by that response. It seems that the graduates of today are increasingly willing to go under the knife to get ahead of others when it comes to getting a job .
One girl told me that she was considering surgery to increase her height. "They break your legs, put in special extending screws, and slowly expand the gap between the two ends of the bone as it re-grows, you can get at least 5 cm taller!"
At that point, I was shocked. I am short, I can't deny that, but I don't think I would put myself through months of agony just to be a few centimetres taller. I don't even bother to wear shoes with thick soles, as I'm not trying to hide the fact that I am just not tall!

When it comes to taking selfies , knowing the following tips can directly affect the quality of your final product. .\nThe use of light is vital to improving image quality. Lights can help avoid shadows and create soft features on your face, so turn your face toward the main light. source. If you want to be creative, play with light angles by turning your body, but make sure the photo is properly exposed and your face is lit from the front or the side. Besides, avoid taking selfies against the main light source or with overhead lighting. Additionally, natural light possesses a warmth that makes you look like you're glowing.\nWhen taking selfies, angles also matter a lot. Hold the camera away from your face, and try to take photos both horizontally and vertically. If not, your face might look bigger than usual. Ideally, the universal selfie angle is 45 degrees above your head. But you should study your face at different angles because finding your best angle requires you having seen all of them.\nOne problem with selfies is that most have distracting backgrounds. You can always do more to show others your best side. Try to simplify the background by taking selfies outdoors or in spacious areas. Document yourself engaging in interesting activities-hiking with family members, visiting landmarks, or working out with friends. At least, you can make the photo appealing by getting rid of your outstretched arm or a background that's too busy.\nYou can also download some photo apps that allow you to adjust the lighting and contrast. Some apps offer useful filters, which can change your skin tone and eliminate pimples   on your face.\n\nQuestion:\nWhich of the following should be avoided when taking selfies?\n\nOptions:\nA: The use of natural light.\nB: A landmark as a background.\nC: Changes of the skin tone.\nD: A busy background.\n\n\nYour Answer:", "role": "user", "name": null, "raw": false}], "model": "rwkv", "stream": false, "stop": ["\n\nUser", "\n\nQuestion", "\n\nQ", "\n\nHuman", "\n\nBob", "\n\nAssistant", "\n\nAnswer", "\n\nA", "\n\nBot", "\n\nAlice", "\n\nObservation", "\n\nUser", "\n\nAss"], "tools": null, "tool_choice": "auto", "user_name": null, "assistant_name": null, "system_name": null, "presystem": false}

### FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES (DO NOT ANSWER) ###

--- EXAMPLE 1 (DO NOT ANSWER) START ---
Passage:
Last week I talked with some of my students about what they wanted to do after they graduated, and what kind of job prospects  they thought they had.
Given that I teach students who are training to be doctors, I was surprised do find that most thought that they would not be able to get the jobs they wanted without "outside help". "What kind of help is that?" I asked, expecting them to tell me that they would need a   or family friend to help them out.
"Surgery ," one replied.
I was pretty alarmed by that response. It seems that the graduates of today are increasingly willing to go under the knife to get ahead of others when it comes to getting a job .
One girl told me that she was considering surgery to increase her height. "They break your legs, put in special extending screws, and slowly expand the gap between the two ends of the bone as it re-grows, you can get at least 5 cm taller!"
At that point, I was shocked. I am short, I can't deny that, but I don't think I would put myself through months of agony just to be a few centimetres taller. I don't even bother to wear shoes with thick soles, as I'm not trying to hide the fact that I am just not tall!
It seems to me that there is a trend towards wanting "perfection" , and that is an ideal that just does not exist in reality.

### FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES (DO NOT ANSWER) ###

--- EXAMPLE 1 (DO NOT ANSWER) START ---
Passage:
Last week I talked with some of my students about what they wanted to do after they graduated, and what kind of job prospects  they thought they had.
Given that I teach students who are training to be doctors, I was surprised do find that most thought that they would not be able to get the jobs they wanted without "outside help". "What kind of help is that?" I asked, expecting them to tell me that they would need a   or family friend to help them out.
"Surgery ," one replied.
I was pretty alarmed by that response. It seems that the graduates of today are increasingly willing to go under the knife to get ahead of others when it comes to getting a job .
One girl told me that she was considering surgery to increase her height. "They break your legs, put in special extending screws, and slowly expand the gap between the two ends of the bone as it re-grows, you can get at least 5 cm taller!"
At that point, I was shocked. I am short, I can't deny that, but I don't think I would put myself through months of agony just to be a few centimetres taller. I don't even bother to wear shoes with thick soles, as I'm not trying to hide the fact that I am just not tall!
It seems to me that there is a trend towards wanting "perfection" , and that is an ideal that just does not exist in reality.

In my opinion, skills, rather than appearance, should determine how successful a person is in his/her chosen career.

### REAL QUESTION — ANSWER THIS ONLY ###
Passage:
Tu Youyou together with William Campbell and Satoshi Omura won the 2015 Nobel Prize for their work against parasitic diseases. Irish-born Campbell and Japanese Omura won half of the prize for discovering a new drug, avermectin, that has helped the battle against river blindness and lymphatic filariasis, as well as showing effectiveness against other parasitic diseases. The Chinese scientist Tu Youyou, an 85-year-old female scientist, was awarded the other half of the prize for the discovery of artemisinin , a drug cure for malaria  that has saved millions of lives all over the world, especially in the developing world.
When the news broke that Tu won the Nobel Prize, there were cheers as well as doubts. It also has highlighted differences in prize-awarding practices between China and the West. Some said the achievement was the result of collective efforts by lots of Chinese scientists, so it was unfair to award the prize only to Tu. Indeed, Chinese science awards are mainly presented to projects, instead of individual scientists. But Western awards tend to honor individual scientists who are the first to come up with a new idea or method. Li Zhenzhen, a researcher of the China Academy of Sciences said that the West believes that the advancement of science comes from individuals' creative minds.
In 1969, Tu started to hold a government project aimed at eliminating malaria. Tu and her teammates experimented with 380 extracts in 2,000 candidate recipes before they finally succeeded in getting the pure substance qinghaosu, later known as artemisinin. In 2011, Tu was awarded the Lasker Debakey Clinical Medical Research Award, commonly referred to as "America's Nobel Prize". (278 words)

### FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES (DO NOT ANSWER) ###

--- EXAMPLE 1 (DO NOT ANSWER) START ---
Passage:
Last week I talked with some of my students about what they wanted to do after they graduated, and what kind of job prospects  they thought they had.
Given that I teach students who are training to be doctors, I was surprised do find that most thought that they would not be able to get the jobs they wanted without "outside help". "What kind of help is that?" I asked, expecting them to tell me that they would need a   or family friend to help them out.
"Surgery ," one replied.
I was pretty alarmed by that response. It seems that the graduates of today are increasingly willing to go under the knife to get ahead of others when it comes to getting a job .
One girl told me that she was considering surgery to increase her height. "They break your legs, put in special extending screws, and slowly expand the gap between the two ends of the bone as it re-grows, you can get at least 5 cm taller!"
At that point, I was shocked. I am short, I can't deny that, but I don't think I would put myself through months of agony just to be a few centimetres taller. I don't even bother to wear shoes with thick soles, as I'm not trying to hide the fact that I am just not tall!
It seems to me that there is a trend towards wanting "perfection" , and that is an ideal that just does not exist in reality.
No one is born perfect, yet magazines, TV shows and movies present images of thin, tall, beautiful people as being the norm. Advertisements for slimming aids, beauty treatments and cosmetic surgery clinics fill the pages of newspapers, further creating an idea that "perfection" is a requirement, and that it must be purchased, no matter what the cost. In my opinion, skills, rather than appearance, should determine how successful a person is in his/her chosen career.

### FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES (DO NOT ANSWER) ###

--- EXAMPLE 1 (DO NOT ANSWER) START ---
Passage:
Last week I talked with some of my students about what they wanted to do after they graduated, and what kind of job prospects  they thought they had.
Given that I teach students who are training to be doctors, I was surprised do find that most thought that they would not be able to get the jobs they wanted without "outside help". "What kind of help is that?" I asked, expecting them to tell me that they would need a   or family friend to help them out.
"Surgery ," one replied.
I was pretty alarmed by that response. It seems that the graduates of today are increasingly willing to go under the knife to get ahead of others when it comes to getting a job .
One girl told me that she was considering surgery to increase her height. "They break your legs, put in special extending screws, and slowly expand the gap between the two ends of the bone as it re-grows, you can get at least 5 cm taller!"
At that point, I was shocked. I am short, I can't deny that, but I don't think I would put myself through months of agony just to be a few centimetres taller. I don't even bother to wear shoes with thick soles, as I'm not trying to hide the fact that I am just not tall!
It seems to me that there is a trend towards wanting "perfection" , and that is an ideal that just does not exist in reality.
No one is born perfect, yet magazines, TV shows and movies present images of thin, tall, beautiful people as being the norm. Advertisements for slimming aids, beauty treatments and cosmetic surgery clinics fill the pages of newspapers, further creating an idea that "perfection" is a requirement, and that it must be purchased, no matter what the cost. In my opinion, skills, rather than appearance, should determine how successful a person is in his/her chosen career.

In order to answer this question, we must first examine whether people really want to preserve the historic feel of an area. Not all historical buildings are attractive. However, there may be other reasons for example, economic   reasons-why they should be preserved.

### FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES (DO NOT ANSWER) ###

--- EXAMPLE 1 (DO NOT ANSWER) START ---
Passage:
Last week I talked with some of my students about what they wanted to do after they graduated, and what kind of job prospects  they thought they had.
Given that I teach students who are training to be doctors, I was surprised do find that most thought that they would not be able to get the jobs they wanted without "outside help". "What kind of help is that?" I asked, expecting them to tell me that they would need a   or family friend to help them out.
"Surgery ," one replied.
I was pretty alarmed by that response. It seems that the graduates of today are increasingly willing to go under the knife to get ahead of others when it comes to getting a job .
One girl told me that she was considering surgery to increase her height. "They break your legs, put in special extending screws, and slowly expand the gap between the two ends of the bone as it re-grows, you can get at least 5 cm taller!"
At that point, I was shocked. I am short, I can't deny that, but I don't think I would put myself through months of agony just to be a few centimetres taller. I don't even bother to wear shoes with thick soles, as I'm not trying to hide the fact that I am just not tall!
It seems to me that there is a trend towards wanting "perfection" , and that is an ideal that just does not exist in reality.
No one is born perfect, yet magazines, TV shows and movies present images of thin, tall, beautiful people as being the norm. Advertisements for slimming aids, beauty treatments and cosmetic surgery clinics fill the pages of newspapers, further creating an idea that "perfection" is a requirement, and that it must be purchased, no matter what the cost. In my opinion, skills, rather than appearance, should determine how successful a person is in his/her chosen career.

### REAL QUESTION — ANSWER THIS ONLY ###
Passage:
Should we allow modern buildings to- be built next to older buildings in a historic area of  a city? In order to answer this question, we must first examine whether people really want to preserve the historic feel of an area. Not all historical buildings are attractive. However, there may be other reasons for example, economic   reasons-why they should be preserved. So, let us assume that historical buildings are both attractive and important to the majority of people. What should we do then if a new building is needed?
In my view, new architectural styles can exist perfectly well alongside an older style. Indeed, there are many examples in my own home town of Tours where modern designs have been placed very successfully next to old buildings. As long as the building in question is pleasing and does not dominate   its surroundings too much, it often improves the attractiveness of the area.
It is true that there are examples of new buildings which have spoilt   the area they are in, but the same can be said of some old buildings too. Yet people still speak against new buildings in historic areas. I think this is simply because people are naturally conservative and do not like change.
Although we have to respect people's feelings as fellow users of the buildings, I believe that it is the duty of the architect and planner to _ . If we always reproduced what was there before,we would all still be living in caves . Thus , I would argue against copying previous architectural styles and choose something fresh and different , even though that might be the more risky choice.

Question:
Which of the following is true according to the author ?

Options:
A: We should reproduce the same old buildings.
B: Buildings should not dominate their surroundings.
C: Some old buildings have spoilt the area they are in.
D: No one understands why people speak against new buildings.

### FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES (DO NOT ANSWER) ###

--- EXAMPLE 1 (DO NOT ANSWER) START ---
Passage:
Last week I talked with some of my students about what they wanted to do after they graduated, and what kind of job prospects  they thought they had.
Given that I teach students who are training to be doctors, I was surprised do find that most thought that they would not be able to get the jobs they wanted without "outside help". "What kind of help is that?" I asked, expecting them to tell me that they would need a   or family friend to help them out.
"Surgery ," one replied.
I was pretty alarmed by that response. It seems that the graduates of today are increasingly willing to go under the knife to get ahead of others when it comes to getting a job .
One girl told me that she was considering surgery to increase her height. "They break your legs, put in special extending screws, and slowly expand the gap between the two ends of the bone as it re-grows, you can get at least 5 cm taller!"
At that point, I was shocked. I am short, I can't deny that, but I don't think I would put myself through months of agony just to be a few centimetres taller. I don't even bother to wear shoes with thick soles, as I'm not trying to hide the fact that I am just not tall!
It seems to me that there is a trend towards wanting "perfection" , and that is an ideal that just does not exist in reality.

Advertisements for slimming aids, beauty treatments and cosmetic surgery clinics fill the pages of newspapers, further creating an idea that "perfection" is a requirement, and that it must be purchased, no matter what the cost. In my opinion, skills, rather than appearance, should determine how successful a person is in his/her chosen career.

Given that I teach students who are training to be doctors, I was surprised do find that most thought that they would not be able to get the jobs they wanted without "outside help". "What kind of help is that?" I asked, expecting them to tell me that they would need a   or family friend to help them out.
"Surgery ," one replied.
I was pretty alarmed by that response. It seems that the graduates of today are increasingly willing to go under the knife to get ahead of others when it comes to getting a job .
One girl told me that she was considering surgery to increase her height. "They break your legs, put in special extending screws, and slowly expand the gap between the two ends of the bone as it re-grows, you can get at least 5 cm taller!"
At that point, I was shocked. I am short, I can't deny that, but I don't think I would put myself through months of agony just to be a few centimetres taller. I don't even bother to wear shoes with thick soles, as I'm not trying to hide the fact that I am just not tall!
It seems to me that there is a trend towards wanting "perfection" , and that is an ideal that just does not exist in reality.
No one is born perfect, yet magazines, TV shows and movies present images of thin, tall, beautiful people as being the norm. Advertisements for slimming aids, beauty treatments and cosmetic surgery clinics fill the pages of newspapers, further creating an idea that "perfection" is a requirement, and that it must be purchased, no matter what the cost. In my opinion, skills, rather than appearance, should determine how successful a person is in his/her chosen career.

Question:
Many graduates today turn to cosmetic surgery to_.

Options:
A: marry a better man/woman
B: become a model
C: get an advantage over others in job-hunting
D: attract more admirers

Correct Answer: C

### REAL QUESTION — ANSWER THIS ONLY ###
Passage:
Should we allow modern buildings to- be built next to older buildings in a historic area of  a city? In order to answer this question, we must first examine whether people really want to preserve the historic feel of an area. Not all historical buildings are attractive. However, there may be other reasons for example, economic   reasons-why they should be preserved. So, let us assume that historical buildings are both attractive and important to the majority of people. What should we do then if a new building is needed?
In my view, new architectural styles can exist perfectly well alongside an older style. Indeed, there are many examples in my own home town of Tours where modern designs have been placed very successfully next to old buildings. As long as the building in question is pleasing and does not dominate   its surroundings too much, it often improves the attractiveness of the area.
It is true that there are examples of new buildings which have spoilt   the area they are in, but the same can be said of some old buildings too. Yet people still speak against new buildings in historic areas. I think this is simply because people are naturally conservative and do not like change.
Although we have to respect people's feelings as fellow users of the buildings, I believe that it is the duty of the architect and planner to _ . If we always reproduced what was there before,we would all still be living in caves . Thus , I would argue against copying previous architectural styles and choose something fresh and different , even though that might be the more risky choice.

Question:
What is the main purpose of the passage?

Options:
A: To explain why people dislike change.
B: To warn that we could end up living in caves.
C: To admit how new buildings have ruined their surroundings.
D: To argue that modern buildings can be built in historic areas.

Passage:
Last week I talked with some of my students about what they wanted to do after they graduated, and what kind of job prospects  they thought they had.
Given that I teach students who are training to be doctors, I was surprised do find that most thought that they would not be able to get the jobs they wanted without "outside help". "What kind of help is that?" I asked, expecting them to tell me that they would need a   or family friend to help them out.
"Surgery ," one replied.
I was pretty alarmed by that response. It seems that the graduates of today are increasingly willing to go under the knife to get ahead of others when it comes to getting a job .
One girl told me that she was considering surgery to increase her height. "They break your legs, put in special extending screws, and slowly expand the gap between the two ends of the bone as it re-grows, you can get at least 5 cm taller!"
At that point, I was shocked. I am short, I can't deny that, but I don't think I would put myself through months of agony just to be a few centimetres taller. I don't even bother to wear shoes with thick soles, as I'm not trying to hide the fact that I am just not tall!

For example , some might say, "I just won a hundred dollars on the lottery   . It was great. Itook that dollar ticket back to the store and turned it in for one hundred dollars! "
This guy is a winner , right?  Maybe , maybe not. We then discover that he bought  $200 worth oftickets, and only one was a winner. He's really a big loser!
He didn't say anything that was false, but he left out important information on purpose. That's called a half-truth. Half-truths are not technically lies, but they are just as dishonest.
Some politicians often use this trick. Let's say that during Governor Smith's last term, her state lostone million jobs and gained three million jobs. Then she seeks another term. One of her opponents says, " During Governor Smith's term, the state lost one million jobs !" That's true. However, anhonest statement would have been , "During Governor Smith's term, the state had a net gain of two million jobs. "
Advertisers will sometimes use half-truths. It's against the law to make false statements, so they try to mislead you with the truth. An advertisement might say, "Nine out of ten doctors advised their patients to take Yucky Pills to cure toothache." It fails to mention that they only asked ten doctors and nine of them work for the Yucky Company.
This kind of deception happens too often. It's a sad fact of life: Lies are lies, and sometimes the truthcan lie as well.

Question:
We may infer that the author believes people should   _  .

Options:
A: buy lottery tickets if possible
B: make use of half-truths
C: be careful about what they are told
D: not trust the Yucky Company

### FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES (DO NOT ANSWER) ###

--- EXAMPLE 1 (DO NOT ANSWER) START ---
Passage:
Last week I talked with some of my students about what they wanted to do after they graduated, and what kind of job prospects  they thought they had.
Given that I teach students who are training to be doctors, I was surprised do find that most thought that they would not be able to get the jobs they wanted without "outside help". "What kind of help is that?" I asked, expecting them to tell me that they would need a   or family friend to help them out.
"Surgery ," one replied.
I was pretty alarmed by that response. It seems that the graduates of today are increasingly willing to go under the knife to get ahead of others when it comes to getting a job .
One girl told me that she was considering surgery to increase her height. "They break your legs, put in special extending screws, and slowly expand the gap between the two ends of the bone as it re-grows, you can get at least 5 cm taller!"
At that point, I was shocked. I am short, I can't deny that, but I don't think I would put myself through months of agony just to be a few centimetres taller. I don't even bother to wear shoes with thick soles, as I'm not trying to hide the fact that I am just not tall!

### REAL QUESTION — ANSWER THIS ONLY ###
Passage:
Do you know of anyone who uses the truth to deceive   ? When someone tells you something that is true, but leaves out important information that should be included, he can give you a false picture.
For example , some might say, "I just won a hundred dollars on the lottery   . It was great. Itook that dollar ticket back to the store and turned it in for one hundred dollars! "
This guy is a winner , right?  Maybe , maybe not. We then discover that he bought  $200 worth oftickets, and only one was a winner. He's really a big loser!
He didn't say anything that was false, but he left out important information on purpose. That's called a half-truth. Half-truths are not technically lies, but they are just as dishonest.
Some politicians often use this trick. Let's say that during Governor Smith's last term, her state lostone million jobs and gained three million jobs. Then she seeks another term. One of her opponents says, " During Governor Smith's term, the state lost one million jobs !" That's true. However, anhonest statement would have been , "During Governor Smith's term, the state had a net gain of two million jobs. "
Advertisers will sometimes use half-truths. It's against the law to make false statements, so they try to mislead you with the truth. An advertisement might say, "Nine out of ten doctors advised their patients to take Yucky Pills to cure toothache." It fails to mention that they only asked ten doctors and nine of them work for the Yucky Company.
This kind of deception happens too often. It's a sad fact of life: Lies are lies, and sometimes the truthcan lie as well.

Question:
How many examples does the writer give to show how the truth is used to deceive?

Options:
A: one
B: Two
C: Three
D: Four

### FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES (DO NOT ANSWER) ###

--- EXAMPLE 1 (DO NOT ANSWER) START ---
Passage:
Last week I talked with some of my students about what they wanted to do after they graduated, and what kind of job prospects  they thought they had.
Given that I teach students who are training to be doctors, I was surprised do find that most thought that they would not be able to get the jobs they wanted without "outside help". "What kind of help is that?" I asked, expecting them to tell me that they would need a   or family friend to help them out.
"Surgery ," one replied.
I was pretty alarmed by that response. It seems that the graduates of today are increasingly willing to go under the knife to get ahead of others when it comes to getting a job .
One girl told me that she was considering surgery to increase her height. "They break your legs, put in special extending screws, and slowly expand the gap between the two ends of the bone as it re-grows, you can get at least 5 cm taller!"
At that point, I was shocked. I am short, I can't deny that, but I don't think I would put myself through months of agony just to be a few centimetres taller. I don't even bother to wear shoes with thick soles, as I'm not trying to hide the fact that I am just not tall!
It seems to me that there is a trend towards wanting "perfection" , and that is an ideal that just does not exist in reality.

### REAL QUESTION — ANSWER THIS ONLY ###
Passage:
Do you know of anyone who uses the truth to deceive   ? When someone tells you something that is true, but leaves out important information that should be included, he can give you a false picture.
For example , some might say, "I just won a hundred dollars on the lottery   . It was great. Itook that dollar ticket back to the store and turned it in for one hundred dollars! "
This guy is a winner , right?  Maybe , maybe not. We then discover that he bought  $200 worth oftickets, and only one was a winner. He's really a big loser!
He didn't say anything that was false, but he left out important information on purpose. That's called a half-truth. Half-truths are not technically lies, but they are just as dishonest.
Some politicians often use this trick. Let's say that during Governor Smith's last term, her state lostone million jobs and gained three million jobs. Then she seeks another term. One of her opponents says, " During Governor Smith's term, the state lost one million jobs !" That's true. However, anhonest statement would have been , "During Governor Smith's term, the state had a net gain of two million jobs. "
Advertisers will sometimes use half-truths. It's against the law to make false statements, so they try to mislead you with the truth. An advertisement might say, "Nine out of ten doctors advised their patients to take Yucky Pills to cure toothache." It fails to mention that they only asked ten doctors and nine of them work for the Yucky Company.
This kind of deception happens too often. It's a sad fact of life: Lies are lies, and sometimes the truthcan lie as well.

Question:
Which of the following is true according to the passage?

Options:
A: Using half truths is against the law.
B: Technically, half truths are in fact lies.
C: Yucky Pills is a very good medicine for toothache.
D: Governor Smith did a good job during her last term.

When someone tells you something that is true, but leaves out important information that should be included, he can give you a false picture.\nFor example , some might say, \"I just won a hundred dollars on the lottery   . It was great. Itook that dollar ticket back to the store and turned it in for one hundred dollars! \"\nThis guy is a winner , right?  Maybe , maybe not. We then discover that he bought  $200 worth oftickets, and only one was a winner. He's really a big loser!\nHe didn't say anything that was false, but he left out important information on purpose. That's called a half-truth. Half-truths are not technically lies, but they are just as dishonest.\nSome politicians often use this trick. Let's say that during Governor Smith's last term, her state lostone million jobs and gained three million jobs. Then she seeks another term. One of her opponents says, \" During Governor Smith's term, the state lost one million jobs !\" That's true. However, anhonest statement would have been , \"During Governor Smith's term, the state had a net gain of two million jobs. \"\nAdvertisers will sometimes use half-truths. It's against the law to make false statements, so they try to mislead you with the truth. An advertisement might say, \"Nine out of ten doctors advised their patients to take Yucky Pills to cure toothache.\" It fails to mention that they only asked ten doctors and nine of them work for the Yucky Company.\nThis kind of deception happens too often. It's a sad fact of life: Lies are lies, and sometimes the truthcan lie as well.\n\nQuestion:\nWhich of the following is true according to the passage?\n\nOptions:\nA: Using half truths is against the law.\nB: Technically, half truths are in fact lies.\nC: Yucky Pills is a very good medicine for toothache.\nD: Governor Smith did a good job during her last term.\n\n\nYour Answer:", "role": "user", "name": null, "raw": false}], "model": "rwkv", "stream": false, "stop": ["\n\nUser", "\n\nQuestion", "\n\nQ", "\n\nHuman", "\n\nBob", "\n\nAssistant", "\n\nAnswer", "\n\nA", "\n\nBot", "\n\nAlice", "\n\nObservation", "\n\nUser", "\n\nAss"], "tools": null, "tool_choice": "auto", "user_name": null, "assistant_name": null, "system_name": null, "presystem": false}

### FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES (DO NOT ANSWER) ###

--- EXAMPLE 1 (DO NOT ANSWER) START ---
Passage:
Last week I talked with some of my students about what they wanted to do after they graduated, and what kind of job prospects  they thought they had.
Given that I teach students who are training to be doctors, I was surprised do find that most thought that they would not be able to get the jobs they wanted without "outside help". "What kind of help is that?" I asked, expecting them to tell me that they would need a   or family friend to help them out.
"Surgery ," one replied.
I was pretty alarmed by that response. It seems that the graduates of today are increasingly willing to go under the knife to get ahead of others when it comes to getting a job .
One girl told me that she was considering surgery to increase her height. "They break your legs, put in special extending screws, and slowly expand the gap between the two ends of the bone as it re-grows, you can get at least 5 cm taller!"
At that point, I was shocked. I am short, I can't deny that, but I don't think I would put myself through months of agony just to be a few centimetres taller. I don't even bother to wear shoes with thick soles, as I'm not trying to hide the fact that I am just not tall!
It seems to me that there is a trend towards wanting "perfection" , and that is an ideal that just does not exist in reality.

### REAL QUESTION — ANSWER THIS ONLY ###
Passage:
If it really is what's on the inside that counts, then a lot of thin people might be in trouble.
Some doctors now think that the internal  fat surrounding important organs like the heart or liver could be as dangerous as the external fat which can be noticed more easily.
"Being thin doesn't surely mean you are not fat," said Dr Jimmy Bell at Imperial College. Since 1994, Bell and his team have scanned nearly 800 people with MRI machines to create "fat maps" showing where people store fat.
According to the result, people who keep their weight through diet rather than exercise are likely to have major deposits of internal fat, even if they are slim.
Even people with normal Body Mass Index scores can have surprising levels of fat deposits inside. Of the women, as many as 45 percent of those with normal BMI scores (20 to 25) actually had too high levels of internal fat. Among men, the percentage was nearly 60 percent.
According to Bell, people who are fat on the inside are actually on the edge of being fat. They eat too many fatty and sugary foods, but they are not eating enough to be fat. Scientists believe we naturally store fat around the belly first, but at some point, the body may start storing it elsewhere.
Doctors are unsure about the exact dangers of internal fat, but some think it has something to do with heart disease and diabetes. They want to prove that internal fat damages the body's communication systems.
The good news is that internal fat can be easily burned off through exercise or even by improving your diet. "If you want to be healthy, there is no _ . Exercise has to be an important part of your lifestyle," Bell said.

Question:
According to the pass age, which of the following is WRONG?

Options:
A: People with heart disease all have internal fat.
B: People can get rid of internal fat by improving diet.
C: Men are more likely to have too much internal fat.
D: Exercise can help to reduce the internal fat.

### FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES (DO NOT ANSWER) ###

Passage:
Last week I talked with some of my students about what they wanted to do after they graduated, and what kind of job prospects  they thought they had.
Given that I teach students who are training to be doctors, I was surprised do find that most thought that they would not be able to get the jobs they wanted without "outside help". "What kind of help is that?" I asked, expecting them to tell me that they would need a   or family friend to help them out.
"Surgery ," one replied.
I was pretty alarmed by that response. It seems that the graduates of today are increasingly willing to go under the knife to get ahead of others when it comes to getting a job .
One girl told me that she was considering surgery to increase her height. "They break your legs, put in special extending screws, and slowly expand the gap between the two ends of the bone as it re-grows, you can get at least 5 cm taller!"
At that point, I was shocked. I am short, I can't deny that, but I don't think I would put myself through months of agony just to be a few centimetres taller. I don't even bother to wear shoes with thick soles, as I'm not trying to hide the fact that I am just not tall!
It seems to me that there is a trend towards wanting "perfection" , and that is an ideal that just does not exist in reality.

### REAL QUESTION — ANSWER THIS ONLY ###
Passage:
If it really is what's on the inside that counts, then a lot of thin people might be in trouble.
Some doctors now think that the internal  fat surrounding important organs like the heart or liver could be as dangerous as the external fat which can be noticed more easily.
"Being thin doesn't surely mean you are not fat," said Dr Jimmy Bell at Imperial College. Since 1994, Bell and his team have scanned nearly 800 people with MRI machines to create "fat maps" showing where people store fat.
According to the result, people who keep their weight through diet rather than exercise are likely to have major deposits of internal fat, even if they are slim.
Even people with normal Body Mass Index scores can have surprising levels of fat deposits inside. Of the women, as many as 45 percent of those with normal BMI scores (20 to 25) actually had too high levels of internal fat. Among men, the percentage was nearly 60 percent.
According to Bell, people who are fat on the inside are actually on the edge of being fat. They eat too many fatty and sugary foods, but they are not eating enough to be fat. Scientists believe we naturally store fat around the belly first, but at some point, the body may start storing it elsewhere.
Doctors are unsure about the exact dangers of internal fat, but some think it has something to do with heart disease and diabetes. They want to prove that internal fat damages the body's communication systems.

### FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES (DO NOT ANSWER) ###

--- EXAMPLE 1 (DO NOT ANSWER) START ---
Passage:
Last week I talked with some of my students about what they wanted to do after they graduated, and what kind of job prospects  they thought they had.
Given that I teach students who are training to be doctors, I was surprised do find that most thought that they would not be able to get the jobs they wanted without "outside help". "What kind of help is that?" I asked, expecting them to tell me that they would need a   or family friend to help them out.
"Surgery ," one replied.
I was pretty alarmed by that response. It seems that the graduates of today are increasingly willing to go under the knife to get ahead of others when it comes to getting a job .
One girl told me that she was considering surgery to increase her height. "They break your legs, put in special extending screws, and slowly expand the gap between the two ends of the bone as it re-grows, you can get at least 5 cm taller!"
At that point, I was shocked. I am short, I can't deny that, but I don't think I would put myself through months of agony just to be a few centimetres taller. I don't even bother to wear shoes with thick soles, as I'm not trying to hide the fact that I am just not tall!
It seems to me that there is a trend towards wanting "perfection" , and that is an ideal that just does not exist in reality.
No one is born perfect, yet magazines, TV shows and movies present images of thin, tall, beautiful people as being the norm. Advertisements for slimming aids, beauty treatments and cosmetic surgery clinics fill the pages of newspapers, further creating an idea that "perfection" is a requirement, and that it must be purchased, no matter what the cost. In my opinion, skills, rather than appearance, should determine how successful a person is in his/her chosen career.

### REAL QUESTION — ANSWER THIS ONLY ###
Passage:
Compared to night owls , people who rise early feel happier and more satisfied with life overall.
But the good news for teenagers is that most people become earlier risers as they age, and this change is also associated with greater feelings of happiness. Researchers at the University of Toronto asked more than 700 people about their preferred time of day and how healthy and happy they generally feel.
They then compared the responses of the group of younger adults aged 17 to  38 with older people ages 59 to 79. Only about seven percent of young adults are morning larks , while by age 60 most people preferred to be up with the dawn. Just seven percent of the oldest people in the study described themselves as night owls.
"We found that older adults reported greater positive emotion than younger adults, and older adults were more likely to be morning - type people than younger adults," study researcher Renee Biss from the University of Toronto reportedly told LiveScience. The "morningness" was associated with greater happiness emotions in both age groups.
Morning trypes also tended to report that they felt healthier than the late risers, according to the study that published in the journal Emition. The researchers said that this apparent health benefit could come from the extra sleep they would enjoy, as their sleeping schedule would fit with society's expectations of rising early for work.
This extra sleep could not only make them feel more clear -mined, but may also  _ their immune system.
"An evening person may go throught their week feeling unhappy because they have to get up earlier than they would like to". But Ms Biss said there was hope for night owls as it was possible for them to turn themselves into morning people.
"One way to do it is to increase your natural light exposure early in the morning, and to wake up earlier and go to bed earlier," she said. "It's easiest if you have a consistent schedule, to make sure you are waking up at the same time every day."

Question:
From the text we know that earlier risers  _  .

Options:
A: like to stay up late and stay happy
B: are more associated with positive feelings
C: are among the majority among they your
D: are healthier than other people

### FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES (DO NOT ANSWER) ###

--- EXAMPLE 1 (DO NOT ANSWER) START ---
Passage:
Last week I talked with some of my students about what they wanted to do after they graduated, and what kind of job prospects  they thought they had.
Given that I teach students who are training to be doctors, I was surprised do find that most thought that they would not be able to get the jobs they wanted without "outside help". "What kind of help is that?" I asked, expecting them to tell me that they would need a   or family friend to help them out.
"Surgery ," one replied.
I was pretty alarmed by that response. It seems that the graduates of today are increasingly willing to go under the knife to get ahead of others when it comes to getting a job .
One girl told me that she was considering surgery to increase her height. "They break your legs, put in special extending screws, and slowly expand the gap between the two ends of the bone as it re-grows, you can get at least 5 cm taller!"
At that point, I was shocked. I am short, I can't deny that, but I don't think I would put myself through months of agony just to be a few centimetres taller. I don't even bother to wear shoes with thick soles, as I'm not trying to hide the fact that I am just not tall!
It seems to me that there is a trend towards wanting "perfection" , and that is an ideal that just does not exist in reality.

### REAL QUESTION — ANSWER THIS ONLY ###
Passage:
Compared to night owls , people who rise early feel happier and more satisfied with life overall.
But the good news for teenagers is that most people become earlier risers as they age, and this change is also associated with greater feelings of happiness. Researchers at the University of Toronto asked more than 700 people about their preferred time of day and how healthy and happy they generally feel.
They then compared the responses of the group of younger adults aged 17 to  38 with older people ages 59 to 79. Only about seven percent of young adults are morning larks , while by age 60 most people preferred to be up with the dawn. Just seven percent of the oldest people in the study described themselves as night owls.
"We found that older adults reported greater positive emotion than younger adults, and older adults were more likely to be morning - type people than younger adults," study researcher Renee Biss from the University of Toronto reportedly told LiveScience. The "morningness" was associated with greater happiness emotions in both age groups.
Morning trypes also tended to report that they felt healthier than the late risers, according to the study that published in the journal Emition. The researchers said that this apparent health benefit could come from the extra sleep they would enjoy, as their sleeping schedule would fit with society's expectations of rising early for work.
This extra sleep could not only make them feel more clear -mined, but may also  _ their immune system.
"An evening person may go throught their week feeling unhappy because they have to get up earlier than they would like to". But Ms Biss said there was hope for night owls as it was possible for them to turn themselves into morning people.
"One way to do it is to increase your natural light exposure early in the morning, and to wake up earlier and go to bed earlier," she said. "It's easiest if you have a consistent schedule, to make sure you are waking up at the same time every day."

Question:
Which of the following is not the way to turn evening people to morning people?

Options:
A: To sleep with the light on in the morning.
B: To fit their schedule with society's expectations.
C: To wake up earlier and go to bed earlier.
D: To expose themselves to more natural light.

### FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES (DO NOT ANSWER) ###

--- EXAMPLE 1 (DO NOT ANSWER) START ---
Passage:
Last week I talked with some of my students about what they wanted to do after they graduated, and what kind of job prospects  they thought they had.
Given that I teach students who are training to be doctors, I was surprised do find that most thought that they would not be able to get the jobs they wanted without "outside help". "What kind of help is that?" I asked, expecting them to tell me that they would need a   or family friend to help them out.
"Surgery ," one replied.
I was pretty alarmed by that response. It seems that the graduates of today are increasingly willing to go under the knife to get ahead of others when it comes to getting a job .
One girl told me that she was considering surgery to increase her height. "They break your legs, put in special extending screws, and slowly expand the gap between the two ends of the bone as it re-grows, you can get at least 5 cm taller!"
At that point, I was shocked. I am short, I can't deny that, but I don't think I would put myself through months of agony just to be a few centimetres taller. I don't even bother to wear shoes with thick soles, as I'm not trying to hide the fact that I am just not tall!
It seems to me that there is a trend towards wanting "perfection" , and that is an ideal that just does not exist in reality.
No one is born perfect, yet magazines, TV shows and movies present images of thin, tall, beautiful people as being the norm. Advertisements for slimming aids, beauty treatments and cosmetic surgery clinics fill the pages of newspapers, further creating an idea that "perfection" is a requirement, and that it must be purchased, no matter what the cost. In my opinion, skills, rather than appearance, should determine how successful a person is in his/her chosen career.

### REAL QUESTION — ANSWER THIS ONLY ###
Passage:
Women are now as likely to use the Internet as men--about two-thirds of both genders, yet a new study shows that gaps remain in what each sex does online.
American men who go online are more likely than women to check the weather, the news, sports, political and financial information, the Pew Internet and American Life Project reported Wednesday. They are also more likely to use the Internet to download music and software and to take a class.
Online women, meanwhile, are bigger users of e-mail, and they are also more likely to go online for religious information and support for health or personal problems.
"For men, it's just, 'give me the facts,'" said Deborah Fallows, who wrote the report based on six years of Pew surveys, "For women, its 'Let's talk about this. Are you worried about this problem?' It's keeping in touch and connecting with people in a richer way."
About two- thirds of the 6,403 adults surveyed by Pew during 2005 said they use the Internet. By gender, it was 68%of the male respondents, and 66%of the female participants---a statistically insignificant difference given the study's margin of sampling error of plus or minus 2%points. In 2002, by contrast, the gap was slightly larger: 61%vs. 57%.
The surveys find that for many activities, such as getting travel information or looking up a phone number, men and women are equally likely to use the Internet.

Question:
According to the passage, which of the following is not what American men who go online do?

Options:
A: Checking the weather and the news.
B: Searching for religious information.
C: Downloading some music.
D: Taking a class.

### FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES (DO NOT ANSWER) ###

--- EXAMPLE 1 (DO NOT ANSWER) START ---
Passage:
Last week I talked with some of my students about what they wanted to do after they graduated, and what kind of job prospects  they thought they had.
Given that I teach students who are training to be doctors, I was surprised do find that most thought that they would not be able to get the jobs they wanted without "outside help". "What kind of help is that?" I asked, expecting them to tell me that they would need a   or family friend to help them out.
"Surgery ," one replied.
I was pretty alarmed by that response. It seems that the graduates of today are increasingly willing to go under the knife to get ahead of others when it comes to getting a job .
One girl told me that she was considering surgery to increase her height. "They break your legs, put in special extending screws, and slowly expand the gap between the two ends of the bone as it re-grows, you can get at least 5 cm taller!"
At that point, I was shocked. I am short, I can't deny that, but I don't think I would put myself through months of agony just to be a few centimetres taller. I don't even bother to wear shoes with thick soles, as I'm not trying to hide the fact that I am just not tall!
It seems to me that there is a trend towards wanting "perfection" , and that is an ideal that just does not exist in reality.
No one is born perfect, yet magazines, TV shows and movies present images of thin, tall, beautiful people as being the norm. Advertisements for slimming aids, beauty treatments and cosmetic surgery clinics fill the pages of newspapers, further creating an idea that "perfection" is a requirement, and that it must be purchased, no matter what the cost. In my opinion, skills, rather than appearance, should determine how successful a person is in his/her chosen career.

### REAL QUESTION — ANSWER THIS ONLY ###
Passage:
Women are now as likely to use the Internet as men--about two-thirds of both genders, yet a new study shows that gaps remain in what each sex does online.
American men who go online are more likely than women to check the weather, the news, sports, political and financial information, the Pew Internet and American Life Project reported Wednesday. They are also more likely to use the Internet to download music and software and to take a class.
Online women, meanwhile, are bigger users of e-mail, and they are also more likely to go online for religious information and support for health or personal problems.
"For men, it's just, 'give me the facts,'" said Deborah Fallows, who wrote the report based on six years of Pew surveys, "For women, its 'Let's talk about this. Are you worried about this problem?' It's keeping in touch and connecting with people in a richer way."
About two- thirds of the 6,403 adults surveyed by Pew during 2005 said they use the Internet. By gender, it was 68%of the male respondents, and 66%of the female participants---a statistically insignificant difference given the study's margin of sampling error of plus or minus 2%points. In 2002, by contrast, the gap was slightly larger: 61%vs. 57%.
The surveys find that for many activities, such as getting travel information or looking up a phone number, men and women are equally likely to use the Internet.

Question:
What is the probable meaning of the sentence "gaps remain in what each sex does online"?

Options:
A: There are some difference between men and women in the US.
B: There is a slight difference between the numbers of men and women online in the US.
C: Men and women in the US have difference tastes about what they do online.
D: Men and women in the US have difference way of surfing the Internet.

### FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES (DO NOT ANSWER) ###

--- EXAMPLE 1 (DO NOT ANSWER) START ---
Passage:
Last week I talked with some of my students about what they wanted to do after they graduated, and what kind of job prospects  they thought they had.
Given that I teach students who are training to be doctors, I was surprised do find that most thought that they would not be able to get the jobs they wanted without "outside help". "What kind of help is that?" I asked, expecting them to tell me that they would need a   or family friend to help them out.
"Surgery ," one replied.
I was pretty alarmed by that response. It seems that the graduates of today are increasingly willing to go under the knife to get ahead of others when it comes to getting a job .
One girl told me that she was considering surgery to increase her height. "They break your legs, put in special extending screws, and slowly expand the gap between the two ends of the bone as it re-grows, you can get at least 5 cm taller!"
At that point, I was shocked. I am short, I can't deny that, but I don't think I would put myself through months of agony just to be a few centimetres taller. I don't even bother to wear shoes with thick soles, as I'm not trying to hide the fact that I am just not tall!
It seems to me that there is a trend towards wanting "perfection" , and that is an ideal that just does not exist in reality.
No one is born perfect, yet magazines, TV shows and movies present images of thin, tall, beautiful people as being the norm. Advertisements for slimming aids, beauty treatments and cosmetic surgery clinics fill the pages of newspapers, further creating an idea that "perfection" is a requirement, and that it must be purchased, no matter what the cost. In my opinion, skills, rather than appearance, should determine how successful a person is in his/her chosen career.

Last week I talked with some of my students about what they wanted to do after they graduated, and what kind of job prospects  they thought they had.
Given that I teach students who are training to be doctors, I was surprised do find that most thought that they would not be able to get the jobs they wanted without "outside help". "What kind of help is that?" I asked, expecting them to tell me that they would need a   or family friend to help them out.
"Surgery ," one replied.
I was pretty alarmed by that response. It seems that the graduates of today are increasingly willing to go under the knife to get ahead of others when it comes to getting a job .
One girl told me that she was considering surgery to increase her height. "They break your legs, put in special extending screws, and slowly expand the gap between the two ends of the bone as it re-grows, you can get at least 5 cm taller!"
At that point, I was shocked. I am short, I can't deny that, but I don't think I would put myself through months of agony just to be a few centimetres taller. I don't even bother to wear shoes with thick soles, as I'm not trying to hide the fact that I am just not tall!
It seems to me that there is a trend towards wanting "perfection" , and that is an ideal that just does not exist in reality.
No one is born perfect, yet magazines, TV shows and movies present images of thin, tall, beautiful people as being the norm. Advertisements for slimming aids, beauty treatments and cosmetic surgery clinics fill the pages of newspapers, further creating an idea that "perfection" is a requirement, and that it must be purchased, no matter what the cost. In my opinion, skills, rather than appearance, should determine how successful a person is in his/her chosen career.

Question:
Many graduates today turn to cosmetic surgery to_.

Options:
A: marry a better man/woman
B: become a model
C: get an advantage over others in job-hunting
D: attract more admirers

Correct Answer: C

### REAL QUESTION — ANSWER THIS ONLY ###
Passage:
Women are now as likely to use the Internet as men--about two-thirds of both genders, yet a new study shows that gaps remain in what each sex does online.
American men who go online are more likely than women to check the weather, the news, sports, political and financial information, the Pew Internet and American Life Project reported Wednesday. They are also more likely to use the Internet to download music and software and to take a class.
Online women, meanwhile, are bigger users of e-mail, and they are also more likely to go online for religious information and support for health or personal problems.
"For men, it's just, 'give me the facts,'" said Deborah Fallows, who wrote the report based on six years of Pew surveys, "For women, its 'Let's talk about this. Are you worried about this problem?' It's keeping in touch and connecting with people in a richer way."
About two- thirds of the 6,403 adults surveyed by Pew during 2005 said they use the Internet. By gender, it was 68%of the male respondents, and 66%of the female participants---a statistically insignificant difference given the study's margin of sampling error of plus or minus 2%points. In 2002, by contrast, the gap was slightly larger: 61%vs. 57%.
The surveys find that for many activities, such as getting travel information or looking up a phone number, men and women are equally likely to use the Internet.

Question:
Which of the following statements is true according to the passage?

Options:
A: A small part of women in the US go on line today.
B: Women in the US going on line are only concerned with personal problems.
C: Men are still more likely to use the Internet than women.
D: The gap between both sexes going online in 2002 was slightly larger than that in 2005.

Passage:
Last week I talked with some of my students about what they wanted to do after they graduated, and what kind of job prospects  they thought they had.
Given that I teach students who are training to be doctors, I was surprised do find that most thought that they would not be able to get the jobs they wanted without "outside help". "What kind of help is that?" I asked, expecting them to tell me that they would need a   or family friend to help them out.
"Surgery ," one replied.
I was pretty alarmed by that response. It seems that the graduates of today are increasingly willing to go under the knife to get ahead of others when it comes to getting a job .
One girl told me that she was considering surgery to increase her height. "They break your legs, put in special extending screws, and slowly expand the gap between the two ends of the bone as it re-grows, you can get at least 5 cm taller!"
At that point, I was shocked. I am short, I can't deny that, but I don't think I would put myself through months of agony just to be a few centimetres taller. I don't even bother to wear shoes with thick soles, as I'm not trying to hide the fact that I am just not tall!

Women are now as likely to use the Internet as men--about two-thirds of both genders, yet a new study shows that gaps remain in what each sex does online.
American men who go online are more likely than women to check the weather, the news, sports, political and financial information, the Pew Internet and American Life Project reported Wednesday. They are also more likely to use the Internet to download music and software and to take a class.
Online women, meanwhile, are bigger users of e-mail, and they are also more likely to go online for religious information and support for health or personal problems.
"For men, it's just, 'give me the facts,'" said Deborah Fallows, who wrote the report based on six years of Pew surveys, "For women, its 'Let's talk about this. Are you worried about this problem?' It's keeping in touch and connecting with people in a richer way."
About two- thirds of the 6,403 adults surveyed by Pew during 2005 said they use the Internet. By gender, it was 68%of the male respondents, and 66%of the female participants---a statistically insignificant difference given the study's margin of sampling error of plus or minus 2%points. In 2002, by contrast, the gap was slightly larger: 61%vs. 57%.
The surveys find that for many activities, such as getting travel information or looking up a phone number, men and women are equally likely to use the Internet.

Question:
What's the author's purpose of writing the article?

Options:
A: To tell us the different aims of men and women in the US who go online.
B: To show why men and women are equally likely to use the Internet.
C: To teach us how to surf the Internet.
D: To offer us some information of both sexes' going online in the US.

Passage:
Last week I talked with some of my students about what they wanted to do after they graduated, and what kind of job prospects  they thought they had.
Given that I teach students who are training to be doctors, I was surprised do find that most thought that they would not be able to get the jobs they wanted without "outside help". "What kind of help is that?" I asked, expecting them to tell me that they would need a   or family friend to help them out.
"Surgery ," one replied.
I was pretty alarmed by that response. It seems that the graduates of today are increasingly willing to go under the knife to get ahead of others when it comes to getting a job .
One girl told me that she was considering surgery to increase her height. "They break your legs, put in special extending screws, and slowly expand the gap between the two ends of the bone as it re-grows, you can get at least 5 cm taller!"
At that point, I was shocked. I am short, I can't deny that, but I don't think I would put myself through months of agony just to be a few centimetres taller. I don't even bother to wear shoes with thick soles, as I'm not trying to hide the fact that I am just not tall!

### FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES (DO NOT ANSWER) ###

--- EXAMPLE 1 (DO NOT ANSWER) START ---
Passage:
Last week I talked with some of my students about what they wanted to do after they graduated, and what kind of job prospects  they thought they had.
Given that I teach students who are training to be doctors, I was surprised do find that most thought that they would not be able to get the jobs they wanted without "outside help". "What kind of help is that?" I asked, expecting them to tell me that they would need a   or family friend to help them out.
"Surgery ," one replied.
I was pretty alarmed by that response. It seems that the graduates of today are increasingly willing to go under the knife to get ahead of others when it comes to getting a job .
One girl told me that she was considering surgery to increase her height. "They break your legs, put in special extending screws, and slowly expand the gap between the two ends of the bone as it re-grows, you can get at least 5 cm taller!"
At that point, I was shocked. I am short, I can't deny that, but I don't think I would put myself through months of agony just to be a few centimetres taller. I don't even bother to wear shoes with thick soles, as I'm not trying to hide the fact that I am just not tall!
It seems to me that there is a trend towards wanting "perfection" , and that is an ideal that just does not exist in reality.

--- EXAMPLE 1 (DO NOT ANSWER) START ---
Passage:
Last week I talked with some of my students about what they wanted to do after they graduated, and what kind of job prospects  they thought they had.
Given that I teach students who are training to be doctors, I was surprised do find that most thought that they would not be able to get the jobs they wanted without "outside help". "What kind of help is that?" I asked, expecting them to tell me that they would need a   or family friend to help them out.
"Surgery ," one replied.
I was pretty alarmed by that response. It seems that the graduates of today are increasingly willing to go under the knife to get ahead of others when it comes to getting a job .
One girl told me that she was considering surgery to increase her height. "They break your legs, put in special extending screws, and slowly expand the gap between the two ends of the bone as it re-grows, you can get at least 5 cm taller!"
At that point, I was shocked. I am short, I can't deny that, but I don't think I would put myself through months of agony just to be a few centimetres taller. I don't even bother to wear shoes with thick soles, as I'm not trying to hide the fact that I am just not tall!
It seems to me that there is a trend towards wanting "perfection" , and that is an ideal that just does not exist in reality.

Advertisements for slimming aids, beauty treatments and cosmetic surgery clinics fill the pages of newspapers, further creating an idea that "perfection" is a requirement, and that it must be purchased, no matter what the cost.

### FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES (DO NOT ANSWER) ###

--- EXAMPLE 1 (DO NOT ANSWER) START ---
Passage:
Last week I talked with some of my students about what they wanted to do after they graduated, and what kind of job prospects  they thought they had.
Given that I teach students who are training to be doctors, I was surprised do find that most thought that they would not be able to get the jobs they wanted without "outside help". "What kind of help is that?" I asked, expecting them to tell me that they would need a   or family friend to help them out.
"Surgery ," one replied.
I was pretty alarmed by that response. It seems that the graduates of today are increasingly willing to go under the knife to get ahead of others when it comes to getting a job .
One girl told me that she was considering surgery to increase her height. "They break your legs, put in special extending screws, and slowly expand the gap between the two ends of the bone as it re-grows, you can get at least 5 cm taller!"
At that point, I was shocked. I am short, I can't deny that, but I don't think I would put myself through months of agony just to be a few centimetres taller. I don't even bother to wear shoes with thick soles, as I'm not trying to hide the fact that I am just not tall!
It seems to me that there is a trend towards wanting "perfection" , and that is an ideal that just does not exist in reality.

Advertisements for slimming aids, beauty treatments and cosmetic surgery clinics fill the pages of newspapers, further creating an idea that "perfection" is a requirement, and that it must be purchased, no matter what the cost. In my opinion, skills, rather than appearance, should determine how successful a person is in his/her chosen career.

### FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES (DO NOT ANSWER) ###

--- EXAMPLE 1 (DO NOT ANSWER) START ---
Passage:
Last week I talked with some of my students about what they wanted to do after they graduated, and what kind of job prospects  they thought they had.
Given that I teach students who are training to be doctors, I was surprised do find that most thought that they would not be able to get the jobs they wanted without "outside help". "What kind of help is that?" I asked, expecting them to tell me that they would need a   or family friend to help them out.
"Surgery ," one replied.
I was pretty alarmed by that response. It seems that the graduates of today are increasingly willing to go under the knife to get ahead of others when it comes to getting a job .
One girl told me that she was considering surgery to increase her height. "They break your legs, put in special extending screws, and slowly expand the gap between the two ends of the bone as it re-grows, you can get at least 5 cm taller!"
At that point, I was shocked. I am short, I can't deny that, but I don't think I would put myself through months of agony just to be a few centimetres taller. I don't even bother to wear shoes with thick soles, as I'm not trying to hide the fact that I am just not tall!
It seems to me that there is a trend towards wanting "perfection" , and that is an ideal that just does not exist in reality.
No one is born perfect, yet magazines, TV shows and movies present images of thin, tall, beautiful people as being the norm. Advertisements for slimming aids, beauty treatments and cosmetic surgery clinics fill the pages of newspapers, further creating an idea that "perfection" is a requirement, and that it must be purchased, no matter what the cost. In my opinion, skills, rather than appearance, should determine how successful a person is in his/her chosen career.

### FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES (DO NOT ANSWER) ###

--- EXAMPLE 1 (DO NOT ANSWER) START ---
Passage:
Last week I talked with some of my students about what they wanted to do after they graduated, and what kind of job prospects  they thought they had.
Given that I teach students who are training to be doctors, I was surprised do find that most thought that they would not be able to get the jobs they wanted without "outside help". "What kind of help is that?" I asked, expecting them to tell me that they would need a   or family friend to help them out.
"Surgery ," one replied.
I was pretty alarmed by that response. It seems that the graduates of today are increasingly willing to go under the knife to get ahead of others when it comes to getting a job .
One girl told me that she was considering surgery to increase her height. "They break your legs, put in special extending screws, and slowly expand the gap between the two ends of the bone as it re-grows, you can get at least 5 cm taller!"
At that point, I was shocked. I am short, I can't deny that, but I don't think I would put myself through months of agony just to be a few centimetres taller. I don't even bother to wear shoes with thick soles, as I'm not trying to hide the fact that I am just not tall!
It seems to me that there is a trend towards wanting "perfection" , and that is an ideal that just does not exist in reality.
No one is born perfect, yet magazines, TV shows and movies present images of thin, tall, beautiful people as being the norm. Advertisements for slimming aids, beauty treatments and cosmetic surgery clinics fill the pages of newspapers, further creating an idea that "perfection" is a requirement, and that it must be purchased, no matter what the cost. In my opinion, skills, rather than appearance, should determine how successful a person is in his/her chosen career.

### FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES (DO NOT ANSWER) ###

--- EXAMPLE 1 (DO NOT ANSWER) START ---
Passage:
Last week I talked with some of my students about what they wanted to do after they graduated, and what kind of job prospects  they thought they had.
Given that I teach students who are training to be doctors, I was surprised do find that most thought that they would not be able to get the jobs they wanted without "outside help". "What kind of help is that?" I asked, expecting them to tell me that they would need a   or family friend to help them out.
"Surgery ," one replied.
I was pretty alarmed by that response. It seems that the graduates of today are increasingly willing to go under the knife to get ahead of others when it comes to getting a job .
One girl told me that she was considering surgery to increase her height. "They break your legs, put in special extending screws, and slowly expand the gap between the two ends of the bone as it re-grows, you can get at least 5 cm taller!"
At that point, I was shocked. I am short, I can't deny that, but I don't think I would put myself through months of agony just to be a few centimetres taller. I don't even bother to wear shoes with thick soles, as I'm not trying to hide the fact that I am just not tall!
It seems to me that there is a trend towards wanting "perfection" , and that is an ideal that just does not exist in reality.
No one is born perfect, yet magazines, TV shows and movies present images of thin, tall, beautiful people as being the norm. Advertisements for slimming aids, beauty treatments and cosmetic surgery clinics fill the pages of newspapers, further creating an idea that "perfection" is a requirement, and that it must be purchased, no matter what the cost. In my opinion, skills, rather than appearance, should determine how successful a person is in his/her chosen career.

Question:

Options:

### REAL QUESTION — ANSWER THIS ONLY ###
Passage:
In the competition of Olympic weightlifting,the athletes try to lift the maximum   weight they can. There are special conditions they have to meet in order to compete:body weight,height and strength.
The Olympic weightlifting mainly tests the limit of explosive strength  .There are not many lifters who really like Olympic weightlifting and the explanation is very simple:they are short of explosive strength.
The weights used for Olympic weightlifting are added in kilograms. The order by which the athletes enter the competition is not general,but it is set depending on the event. Usually the athlete with the lowest weight begins. If he/she is not successful,he/she can try later. There is a maximum of three lifts allowed for every competition.
For many years Olympic weightlifting was only for men. However,now women also take part in Olympic weightlifting. It was at the beginning of the 21st century that women's competitions entered an organized professional environment. For women,Olympic weightlifting is more difficult because of their different body structure. However,strength training techniques   are widely and successfully used by women,too.
Lots of the athletes who've ended up in Olympic weightlifting competitions have started with strength training only to improve their muscle condition and their body power. However,the demarcation line   is not still very clear between power training and Olympic weightlifting. This is how so many lifters have got into Olympic weightlifting competition,even if their purpose was different at the beginning.

Question:
In the competition of Olympic weightlifting,athletes need to be all of the following EXCEPT  _  .

Options:
A: the right age
B: the right height
C: the right weight
D: the right strength

"What kind of help is that?" I asked, expecting them to tell me that they would need a   or family friend to help them out.
"Surgery ," one replied.
I was pretty alarmed by that response. It seems that the graduates of today are increasingly willing to go under the knife to get ahead of others when it comes to getting a job .
One girl told me that she was considering surgery to increase her height. "They break your legs, put in special extending screws, and slowly expand the gap between the two ends of the bone as it re-grows, you can get at least 5 cm taller!"
At that point, I was shocked. I am short, I can't deny that, but I don't think I would put myself through months of agony just to be a few centimetres taller. I don't even bother to wear shoes with thick soles, as I'm not trying to hide the fact that I am just not tall!
It seems to me that there is a trend towards wanting "perfection" , and that is an ideal that just does not exist in reality.

One girl told me that she was considering surgery to increase her height. "They break your legs, put in special extending screws, and slowly expand the gap between the two ends of the bone as it re-grows, you can get at least 5 cm taller!"
At that point, I was shocked. I am short, I can't deny that, but I don't think I would put myself through months of agony just to be a few centimetres taller. I don't even bother to wear shoes with thick soles, as I'm not trying to hide the fact that I am just not tall!

No one is born perfect, yet magazines, TV shows and movies present images of thin, tall, beautiful people as being the norm.

In my opinion, skills, rather than appearance, should determine how successful a person is in his/her chosen career.

Question:
According to the passage, the author believes that_.

Options:
A: everyone should purchase perfection, whatever the cost
B: it's right for graduates to ask for others to help them out in hunting for jobs
C: it is one's appearance instead of skills that really matters in one's career
D: media are to blame for misleading young people in their seeking for surgery

Correct Answer: D

### REAL QUESTION — ANSWER THIS ONLY ###
Passage:
In the competition of Olympic weightlifting,the athletes try to lift the maximum   weight they can. There are special conditions they have to meet in order to compete:body weight,height and strength.
The Olympic weightlifting mainly tests the limit of explosive strength  .There are not many lifters who really like Olympic weightlifting and the explanation is very simple:they are short of explosive strength.
The weights used for Olympic weightlifting are added in kilograms. The order by which the athletes enter the competition is not general,but it is set depending on the event. Usually the athlete with the lowest weight begins. If he/she is not successful,he/she can try later. There is a maximum of three lifts allowed for every competition.
For many years Olympic weightlifting was only for men. However,now women also take part in Olympic weightlifting. It was at the beginning of the 21st century that women's competitions entered an organized professional environment. For women,Olympic weightlifting is more difficult because of their different body structure. However,strength training techniques   are widely and successfully used by women,too.
Lots of the athletes who've ended up in Olympic weightlifting competitions have started with strength training only to improve their muscle condition and their body power. However,the demarcation line   is not still very clear between power training and Olympic weightlifting. This is how so many lifters have got into Olympic weightlifting competition,even if their purpose was different at the beginning.

Question:
How many more times can a lifter try if he/she fails for the first time?

Options:
A: One.
B: Two.
C: Three.
D: Four.

There are special conditions they have to meet in order to compete:body weight,height and strength.\nThe Olympic weightlifting mainly tests the limit of explosive strength  .There are not many lifters who really like Olympic weightlifting and the explanation is very simple:they are short of explosive strength.\nThe weights used for Olympic weightlifting are added in kilograms. The order by which the athletes enter the competition is not general,but it is set depending on the event. Usually the athlete with the lowest weight begins. If he/she is not successful,he/she can try later. There is a maximum of three lifts allowed for every competition.\nFor many years Olympic weightlifting was only for men. However,now women also take part in Olympic weightlifting. It was at the beginning of the 21st century that women's competitions entered an organized professional environment. For women,Olympic weightlifting is more difficult because of their different body structure. However,strength training techniques   are widely and successfully used by women,too.\nLots of the athletes who've ended up in Olympic weightlifting competitions have started with strength training only to improve their muscle condition and their body power. However,the demarcation line   is not still very clear between power training and Olympic weightlifting. This is how so many lifters have got into Olympic weightlifting competition,even if their purpose was different at the beginning.\n\nQuestion:\nAccording to the passage,many athletes began to practice weightlifting because they  wanted to  _  .\n\nOptions:\nA: take part in the Olympics\nB: get a reward in the competition\nC: strengthen their body power\nD: test the limit of explosive strength\n\n\nYour Answer:", "role": "user", "name": null, "raw": false}], "model": "rwkv", "stream": false, "stop": ["\n\nUser", "\n\nQuestion", "\n\nQ", "\n\nHuman", "\n\nBob", "\n\nAssistant", "\n\nAnswer", "\n\nA", "\n\nBot", "\n\nAlice", "\n\nObservation", "\n\nUser", "\n\nAss"], "tools": null, "tool_choice": "auto", "user_name": null, "assistant_name": null, "system_name": null, "presystem": false}

### FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES (DO NOT ANSWER) ###

--- EXAMPLE 1 (DO NOT ANSWER) START ---
Passage:
Last week I talked with some of my students about what they wanted to do after they graduated, and what kind of job prospects  they thought they had.
Given that I teach students who are training to be doctors, I was surprised do find that most thought that they would not be able to get the jobs they wanted without "outside help". "What kind of help is that?" I asked, expecting them to tell me that they would need a   or family friend to help them out.
"Surgery ," one replied.
I was pretty alarmed by that response. It seems that the graduates of today are increasingly willing to go under the knife to get ahead of others when it comes to getting a job .
One girl told me that she was considering surgery to increase her height. "They break your legs, put in special extending screws, and slowly expand the gap between the two ends of the bone as it re-grows, you can get at least 5 cm taller!"
At that point, I was shocked. I am short, I can't deny that, but I don't think I would put myself through months of agony just to be a few centimetres taller. I don't even bother to wear shoes with thick soles, as I'm not trying to hide the fact that I am just not tall!

### REAL QUESTION — ANSWER THIS ONLY ###
Passage:
New Zealand fishermen caught what may prove to be a world-record-breaking colossal squid  .
In the cold, dark waters of the Antarctic hides a creature with eight arms, two super long tentacles   and eyes as big as dinner plates. Sound like something out of a science fiction movie? Think again.
On February 21, New Zealand fishermen landed a colossal squid the length of a school bus. They had been fishing with long lines for Chilean sea bass   in the waters off the coast of New Zealand when they caught the rare squid. With two hours of hard work, the crew skillfully pulled the creature into a net and dragged it aboard their ship.
Scientists estimate   that the animal weighs about a half ton and is about 40 feet long. That would make this colossal squid the biggest on record.
First identified in 1925 after two tentacles were found in a whale's stomach, the colossal squid has long been a mystery. The animals are not easy to observe because they can go down to ocean depths of 6,500 feet. What scientists do know from studying the bodies of a half dozen colossal squids is that they are fierce hunters.
The recently captured colossal squid has been frozen to keep it for scientific study. It will be transported to New Zealand's national museum, Te Papa, in the capital city of Wellington. Experts believe it to be the first adult male ever caught undamaged. Scientists hope to learn more about the colossal squid's diet, behavior and reproductive   patterns.
"Scientists will be very interested in this amazing creature," said New Zealand Fisheries Minister Jim Anderton. "It adds immeasurably to our understanding of the marine environment."

Question:
Why is it usually difficult for experts to observe the squid?

Options:
A: Because it moves too fast.
B: Because it is too large.
C: Because it is very dangerous.
D: Because it can go down to deep ocean.

### FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES (DO NOT ANSWER) ###

--- EXAMPLE 1 (DO NOT ANSWER) START ---
Passage:
Last week I talked with some of my students about what they wanted to do after they graduated, and what kind of job prospects  they thought they had.
Given that I teach students who are training to be doctors, I was surprised do find that most thought that they would not be able to get the jobs they wanted without "outside help". "What kind of help is that?" I asked, expecting them to tell me that they would need a   or family friend to help them out.
"Surgery ," one replied.
I was pretty alarmed by that response. It seems that the graduates of today are increasingly willing to go under the knife to get ahead of others when it comes to getting a job .
One girl told me that she was considering surgery to increase her height. "They break your legs, put in special extending screws, and slowly expand the gap between the two ends of the bone as it re-grows, you can get at least 5 cm taller!"
At that point, I was shocked. I am short, I can't deny that, but I don't think I would put myself through months of agony just to be a few centimetres taller. I don't even bother to wear shoes with thick soles, as I'm not trying to hide the fact that I am just not tall!
It seems to me that there is a trend towards wanting "perfection" , and that is an ideal that just does not exist in reality.

Passage:
New Zealand fishermen caught what may prove to be a world-record-breaking colossal squid  .
In the cold, dark waters of the Antarctic hides a creature with eight arms, two super long tentacles   and eyes as big as dinner plates. Sound like something out of a science fiction movie? Think again.
On February 21, New Zealand fishermen landed a colossal squid the length of a school bus. They had been fishing with long lines for Chilean sea bass   in the waters off the coast of New Zealand when they caught the rare squid. With two hours of hard work, the crew skillfully pulled the creature into a net and dragged it aboard their ship.
Scientists estimate   that the animal weighs about a half ton and is about 40 feet long. That would make this colossal squid the biggest on record.
First identified in 1925 after two tentacles were found in a whale's stomach, the colossal squid has long been a mystery.

"Scientists will be very interested in this amazing creature," said New Zealand Fisheries Minister Jim Anderton. "It adds immeasurably to our understanding of the marine environment."

Passage:
Last week I talked with some of my students about what they wanted to do after they graduated, and what kind of job prospects  they thought they had.
Given that I teach students who are training to be doctors, I was surprised do find that most thought that they would not be able to get the jobs they wanted without "outside help". "What kind of help is that?" I asked, expecting them to tell me that they would need a   or family friend to help them out.
"Surgery ," one replied.
I was pretty alarmed by that response. It seems that the graduates of today are increasingly willing to go under the knife to get ahead of others when it comes to getting a job .
One girl told me that she was considering surgery to increase her height. "They break your legs, put in special extending screws, and slowly expand the gap between the two ends of the bone as it re-grows, you can get at least 5 cm taller!"
At that point, I was shocked. I am short, I can't deny that, but I don't think I would put myself through months of agony just to be a few centimetres taller. I don't even bother to wear shoes with thick soles, as I'm not trying to hide the fact that I am just not tall!
It seems to me that there is a trend towards wanting "perfection" , and that is an ideal that just does not exist in reality.

### REAL QUESTION — ANSWER THIS ONLY ###
Passage:
New Zealand fishermen caught what may prove to be a world-record-breaking colossal squid  .
In the cold, dark waters of the Antarctic hides a creature with eight arms, two super long tentacles   and eyes as big as dinner plates. Sound like something out of a science fiction movie? Think again.
On February 21, New Zealand fishermen landed a colossal squid the length of a school bus. They had been fishing with long lines for Chilean sea bass   in the waters off the coast of New Zealand when they caught the rare squid. With two hours of hard work, the crew skillfully pulled the creature into a net and dragged it aboard their ship.
Scientists estimate   that the animal weighs about a half ton and is about 40 feet long. That would make this colossal squid the biggest on record.
First identified in 1925 after two tentacles were found in a whale's stomach, the colossal squid has long been a mystery. The animals are not easy to observe because they can go down to ocean depths of 6,500 feet. What scientists do know from studying the bodies of a half dozen colossal squids is that they are fierce hunters.
The recently captured colossal squid has been frozen to keep it for scientific study. It will be transported to New Zealand's national museum, Te Papa, in the capital city of Wellington. Experts believe it to be the first adult male ever caught undamaged. Scientists hope to learn more about the colossal squid's diet, behavior and reproductive   patterns.
"Scientists will be very interested in this amazing creature," said New Zealand Fisheries Minister Jim Anderton. "It adds immeasurably to our understanding of the marine environment."

Question:
What's the purpose of catching such a huge squid?

Options:
A: To make it into food.
B: To set a world record.
C: To do research on it.
D: To display it for visitors.

### FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES (DO NOT ANSWER) ###

--- EXAMPLE 1 (DO NOT ANSWER) START ---
Passage:
Last week I talked with some of my students about what they wanted to do after they graduated, and what kind of job prospects  they thought they had.
Given that I teach students who are training to be doctors, I was surprised do find that most thought that they would not be able to get the jobs they wanted without "outside help". "What kind of help is that?" I asked, expecting them to tell me that they would need a   or family friend to help them out.
"Surgery ," one replied.
I was pretty alarmed by that response. It seems that the graduates of today are increasingly willing to go under the knife to get ahead of others when it comes to getting a job .
One girl told me that she was considering surgery to increase her height. "They break your legs, put in special extending screws, and slowly expand the gap between the two ends of the bone as it re-grows, you can get at least 5 cm taller!"
At that point, I was shocked. I am short, I can't deny that, but I don't think I would put myself through months of agony just to be a few centimetres taller. I don't even bother to wear shoes with thick soles, as I'm not trying to hide the fact that I am just not tall!
It seems to me that there is a trend towards wanting "perfection" , and that is an ideal that just does not exist in reality.

Advertisements for slimming aids, beauty treatments and cosmetic surgery clinics fill the pages of newspapers, further creating an idea that "perfection" is a requirement, and that it must be purchased, no matter what the cost. In my opinion, skills, rather than appearance, should determine how successful a person is in his/her chosen career.

### REAL QUESTION — ANSWER THIS ONLY ###
Passage:
New Zealand fishermen caught what may prove to be a world-record-breaking colossal squid  .
In the cold, dark waters of the Antarctic hides a creature with eight arms, two super long tentacles   and eyes as big as dinner plates. Sound like something out of a science fiction movie? Think again.
On February 21, New Zealand fishermen landed a colossal squid the length of a school bus. They had been fishing with long lines for Chilean sea bass   in the waters off the coast of New Zealand when they caught the rare squid. With two hours of hard work, the crew skillfully pulled the creature into a net and dragged it aboard their ship.
Scientists estimate   that the animal weighs about a half ton and is about 40 feet long. That would make this colossal squid the biggest on record.
First identified in 1925 after two tentacles were found in a whale's stomach, the colossal squid has long been a mystery. The animals are not easy to observe because they can go down to ocean depths of 6,500 feet. What scientists do know from studying the bodies of a half dozen colossal squids is that they are fierce hunters.
The recently captured colossal squid has been frozen to keep it for scientific study. It will be transported to New Zealand's national museum, Te Papa, in the capital city of Wellington. Experts believe it to be the first adult male ever caught undamaged. Scientists hope to learn more about the colossal squid's diet, behavior and reproductive   patterns.
"Scientists will be very interested in this amazing creature," said New Zealand Fisheries Minister Jim Anderton. "It adds immeasurably to our understanding of the marine environment."

Question:
What would be the best title for the passage?

Options:
A: The biggest squid ever found
B: Scientific research on squid
C: The lifestyle of the colossal squid
D: How the fishermen caught the squid

### FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES (DO NOT ANSWER) ###

--- EXAMPLE 1 (DO NOT ANSWER) START ---
Passage:
Last week I talked with some of my students about what they wanted to do after they graduated, and what kind of job prospects  they thought they had.
Given that I teach students who are training to be doctors, I was surprised do find that most thought that they would not be able to get the jobs they wanted without "outside help". "What kind of help is that?" I asked, expecting them to tell me that they would need a   or family friend to help them out.
"Surgery ," one replied.
I was pretty alarmed by that response. It seems that the graduates of today are increasingly willing to go under the knife to get ahead of others when it comes to getting a job .
One girl told me that she was considering surgery to increase her height. "They break your legs, put in special extending screws, and slowly expand the gap between the two ends of the bone as it re-grows, you can get at least 5 cm taller!"
At that point, I was shocked. I am short, I can't deny that, but I don't think I would put myself through months of agony just to be a few centimetres taller. I don't even bother to wear shoes with thick soles, as I'm not trying to hide the fact that I am just not tall!
It seems to me that there is a trend towards wanting "perfection" , and that is an ideal that just does not exist in reality.
No one is born perfect, yet magazines, TV shows and movies present images of thin, tall, beautiful people as being the norm. Advertisements for slimming aids, beauty treatments and cosmetic surgery clinics fill the pages of newspapers, further creating an idea that "perfection" is a requirement, and that it must be purchased, no matter what the cost. In my opinion, skills, rather than appearance, should determine how successful a person is in his/her chosen career.

Passage:
3D cinema has been around since the early 20th century, but Hollywood brought the technology back In 2007. Many thought it was just a trick to make more money. But then came Avatar, the first must-see movie in 3D.

Who knows what the future holds for 3D? Steven Spielberg recently said, 'Tm hoping 3D gets to a point where people dorft notice it. Because then it just becomes another tool and helps tell a story."

### FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES (DO NOT ANSWER) ###

--- EXAMPLE 1 (DO NOT ANSWER) START ---
Passage:
Last week I talked with some of my students about what they wanted to do after they graduated, and what kind of job prospects  they thought they had.
Given that I teach students who are training to be doctors, I was surprised do find that most thought that they would not be able to get the jobs they wanted without "outside help". "What kind of help is that?" I asked, expecting them to tell me that they would need a   or family friend to help them out.
"Surgery ," one replied.
I was pretty alarmed by that response. It seems that the graduates of today are increasingly willing to go under the knife to get ahead of others when it comes to getting a job .
One girl told me that she was considering surgery to increase her height. "They break your legs, put in special extending screws, and slowly expand the gap between the two ends of the bone as it re-grows, you can get at least 5 cm taller!"
At that point, I was shocked. I am short, I can't deny that, but I don't think I would put myself through months of agony just to be a few centimetres taller. I don't even bother to wear shoes with thick soles, as I'm not trying to hide the fact that I am just not tall!
It seems to me that there is a trend towards wanting "perfection" , and that is an ideal that just does not exist in reality.
No one is born perfect, yet magazines, TV shows and movies present images of thin, tall, beautiful people as being the norm. Advertisements for slimming aids, beauty treatments and cosmetic surgery clinics fill the pages of newspapers, further creating an idea that "perfection" is a requirement, and that it must be purchased, no matter what the cost. In my opinion, skills, rather than appearance, should determine how successful a person is in his/her chosen career.

Question:
We can know from the passage that the author works as a_.

Options:
A: doctor

C: teacher

### REAL QUESTION — ANSWER THIS ONLY ###
Passage:
3D cinema has been around since the early 20th century, but Hollywood brought the technology back In 2007. Many thought it was just a trick to make more money. But then came Avatar, the first must-see movie in 3D.
But since Avatar, 3D cinema has struggled. In 2010, several 3D movies bombed at the box office. And by late 2010, Some people said the technology was dead. Of course, this isn't the first time Hollywood has struggled with new technology. Although sound was added to movies in the late 1920s, it took audiences time to get used to the new technology. But in the end, sound and color became the standard. James Cameron, director of Avatar, thinks we're going through the same process with 3D.
Some say cinemas are charging too much for 3D movies. In the US, seeing a 3D movie can cost up to $7.5 more than seeing it in 2D. Also, a recent study at California State University found audiences don't actually enjoy movies in 3D any more than in 2D. Walter Murch , a famous movie editor, wrote in 2011 that human beings have no ability to process 3D images. Watching a 3D movie confuses our brain and this is why some people get headaches.
But James Cameron disagrees. In fact, he recently predicted that in five years all movies will be in 3D. And there are signs that 3D is fighting back. More 3D movies were put on the market in 2012 than ever before. The Lion King 3D recently made over US $150 million at the box office, and Cameron's Titanic 3D made even more.
Who knows what the future holds for 3D? Steven Spielberg recently said, 'Tm hoping 3D gets to a point where people dorft notice it. Because then it just becomes another tool and helps tell a story."

Question:
In Walter Murch7S opinion, 3D movies  _  .

Options:
A: bring moviemakers great profits
B: are more expensive than 2D movies
C: do great harm to people's health
D: are unsuitable for people to watch

### FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES (DO NOT ANSWER) ###

--- EXAMPLE 1 (DO NOT ANSWER) START ---
Passage:
Last week I talked with some of my students about what they wanted to do after they graduated, and what kind of job prospects  they thought they had.
Given that I teach students who are training to be doctors, I was surprised do find that most thought that they would not be able to get the jobs they wanted without "outside help". "What kind of help is that?" I asked, expecting them to tell me that they would need a   or family friend to help them out.
"Surgery ," one replied.
I was pretty alarmed by that response. It seems that the graduates of today are increasingly willing to go under the knife to get ahead of others when it comes to getting a job .
One girl told me that she was considering surgery to increase her height. "They break your legs, put in special extending screws, and slowly expand the gap between the two ends of the bone as it re-grows, you can get at least 5 cm taller!"
At that point, I was shocked. I am short, I can't deny that, but I don't think I would put myself through months of agony just to be a few centimetres taller. I don't even bother to wear shoes with thick soles, as I'm not trying to hide the fact that I am just not tall!
It seems to me that there is a trend towards wanting "perfection" , and that is an ideal that just does not exist in reality.
No one is born perfect, yet magazines, TV shows and movies present images of thin, tall, beautiful people as being the norm.

Passage:
Last week I talked with some of my students about what they wanted to do after they graduated, and what kind of job prospects  they thought they had.
Given that I teach students who are training to be doctors, I was surprised do find that most thought that they would not be able to get the jobs they wanted without "outside help". "What kind of help is that?" I asked, expecting them to tell me that they would need a   or family friend to help them out.
"Surgery ," one replied.

### REAL QUESTION — ANSWER THIS ONLY ###
Passage:
3D cinema has been around since the early 20th century, but Hollywood brought the technology back In 2007. Many thought it was just a trick to make more money. But then came Avatar, the first must-see movie in 3D.
But since Avatar, 3D cinema has struggled. In 2010, several 3D movies bombed at the box office. And by late 2010, Some people said the technology was dead. Of course, this isn't the first time Hollywood has struggled with new technology. Although sound was added to movies in the late 1920s, it took audiences time to get used to the new technology. But in the end, sound and color became the standard. James Cameron, director of Avatar, thinks we're going through the same process with 3D.
Some say cinemas are charging too much for 3D movies. In the US, seeing a 3D movie can cost up to $7.5 more than seeing it in 2D. Also, a recent study at California State University found audiences don't actually enjoy movies in 3D any more than in 2D. Walter Murch , a famous movie editor, wrote in 2011 that human beings have no ability to process 3D images. Watching a 3D movie confuses our brain and this is why some people get headaches.
But James Cameron disagrees. In fact, he recently predicted that in five years all movies will be in 3D. And there are signs that 3D is fighting back. More 3D movies were put on the market in 2012 than ever before. The Lion King 3D recently made over US $150 million at the box office, and Cameron's Titanic 3D made even more.
Who knows what the future holds for 3D? Steven Spielberg recently said, 'Tm hoping 3D gets to a point where people dorft notice it. Because then it just becomes another tool and helps tell a story."

Question:
What can we learn from the text?

Options:
A: Avatar was the first 3D movie.
B: 3D cinema has existed for years.
C: Titanic 3D has made the most money.
D: 2012 witnessed the coming of 3D's time.

### FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES (DO NOT ANSWER) ###

--- EXAMPLE 1 (DO NOT ANSWER) START ---
Passage:
Last week I talked with some of my students about what they wanted to do after they graduated, and what kind of job prospects  they thought they had.
Given that I teach students who are training to be doctors, I was surprised do find that most thought that they would not be able to get the jobs they wanted without "outside help". "What kind of help is that?" I asked, expecting them to tell me that they would need a   or family friend to help them out.
"Surgery ," one replied.
I was pretty alarmed by that response. It seems that the graduates of today are increasingly willing to go under the knife to get ahead of others when it comes to getting a job .
One girl told me that she was considering surgery to increase her height. "They break your legs, put in special extending screws, and slowly expand the gap between the two ends of the bone as it re-grows, you can get at least 5 cm taller!"
At that point, I was shocked. I am short, I can't deny that, but I don't think I would put myself through months of agony just to be a few centimetres taller. I don't even bother to wear shoes with thick soles, as I'm not trying to hide the fact that I am just not tall!
It seems to me that there is a trend towards wanting "perfection" , and that is an ideal that just does not exist in reality.
No one is born perfect, yet magazines, TV shows and movies present images of thin, tall, beautiful people as being the norm. Advertisements for slimming aids, beauty treatments and cosmetic surgery clinics fill the pages of newspapers, further creating an idea that "perfection" is a requirement, and that it must be purchased, no matter what the cost. In my opinion, skills, rather than appearance, should determine how successful a person is in his/her chosen career.

Last week I talked with some of my students about what they wanted to do after they graduated, and what kind of job prospects  they thought they had.
Given that I teach students who are training to be doctors, I was surprised do find that most thought that they would not be able to get the jobs they wanted without "outside help". "What kind of help is that?" I asked, expecting them to tell me that they would need a   or family friend to help them out.
"Surgery ," one replied.
I was pretty alarmed by that response. It seems that the graduates of today are increasingly willing to go under the knife to get ahead of others when it comes to getting a job .
One girl told me that she was considering surgery to increase her height. "They break your legs, put in special extending screws, and slowly expand the gap between the two ends of the bone as it re-grows, you can get at least 5 cm taller!"
At that point, I was shocked. I am short, I can't deny that, but I don't think I would put myself through months of agony just to be a few centimetres taller. I don't even bother to wear shoes with thick soles, as I'm not trying to hide the fact that I am just not tall!
It seems to me that there is a trend towards wanting "perfection" , and that is an ideal that just does not exist in reality.
No one is born perfect, yet magazines, TV shows and movies present images of thin, tall, beautiful people as being the norm. Advertisements for slimming aids, beauty treatments and cosmetic surgery clinics fill the pages of newspapers, further creating an idea that "perfection" is a requirement, and that it must be purchased, no matter what the cost. In my opinion, skills, rather than appearance, should determine how successful a person is in his/her chosen career.

Question:
According to the passage, the author believes that_.

Options:
A: everyone should purchase perfection, whatever the cost
B: it's right for graduates to ask for others to help them out in hunting for jobs
C: it is one's appearance instead of skills that really matters in one's career
D: media are to blame for misleading young people in their seeking for surgery

Correct Answer: D

### REAL QUESTION — ANSWER THIS ONLY ###
Passage:
I can't count how many times people have complained, while shaking their heads in obvious disappointment,"just don't know what is with teenagers today."
The other day I was in my car on my way to the farmers market when I passed two teens standing by the side of the road with a car washing sign. My car was _ and my heart was full, so I pulled over. There was a group directing the cars and another group spraying them down. As sponges  were wiped over every square inch of my dirty car, I sat enjoying the little water bottles. I was amazed at why forty to fifty teenagers had devoted their Saturday to washing cars.
After I handed them a twenty-dollar bill I asked what they were raising money for. They explained to me that a friend of theirs, C.T.Schmitz, had recently died of cancer. He was only fifteen years old. He had gone to school with a lot of the teenagers who were there that day and each of them had memories of a boy sweeter than any they had known. His friend Kevin had decided to put this car wash together because he wanted to honor his friend and also bring together his classmates with his boy scout troop . He told me that they wanted to plant a tree in front of their school and if they raised enough money they would put a plaque  there also. Both would be in memory of their friend C.T.
They handed me a bag of homemade cookies with my receipt  saying"Thanks for helping us plant a tree of C.T."
Yeah! I don't know what is with teenagers today!

Question:
From the passage we can know that the boys were raising money to   _  .

Options:
A: buy a plaque for their school .
B: help those who suffered from cancer.
C: first plant a tree in memory of their friend.
D: put a plaque near their friend's home

### FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES (DO NOT ANSWER) ###

--- EXAMPLE 1 (DO NOT ANSWER) START ---
Passage:
Last week I talked with some of my students about what they wanted to do after they graduated, and what kind of job prospects  they thought they had.
Given that I teach students who are training to be doctors, I was surprised do find that most thought that they would not be able to get the jobs they wanted without "outside help". "What kind of help is that?" I asked, expecting them to tell me that they would need a   or family friend to help them out.
"Surgery ," one replied.
I was pretty alarmed by that response. It seems that the graduates of today are increasingly willing to go under the knife to get ahead of others when it comes to getting a job .
One girl told me that she was considering surgery to increase her height. "They break your legs, put in special extending screws, and slowly expand the gap between the two ends of the bone as it re-grows, you can get at least 5 cm taller!"
At that point, I was shocked. I am short, I can't deny that, but I don't think I would put myself through months of agony just to be a few centimetres taller. I don't even bother to wear shoes with thick soles, as I'm not trying to hide the fact that I am just not tall!
It seems to me that there is a trend towards wanting "perfection" , and that is an ideal that just does not exist in reality.

There was a group directing the cars and another group spraying them down. As sponges  were wiped over every square inch of my dirty car, I sat enjoying the little water bottles. I was amazed at why forty to fifty teenagers had devoted their Saturday to washing cars.
After I handed them a twenty-dollar bill I asked what they were raising money for. They explained to me that a friend of theirs, C.T.Schmitz, had recently died of cancer. He was only fifteen years old. He had gone to school with a lot of the teenagers who were there that day and each of them had memories of a boy sweeter than any they had known.

My car was _ and my heart was full, so I pulled over. There was a group directing the cars and another group spraying them down. As sponges  were wiped over every square inch of my dirty car, I sat enjoying the little water bottles. I was amazed at why forty to fifty teenagers had devoted their Saturday to washing cars.\nAfter I handed them a twenty-dollar bill I asked what they were raising money for. They explained to me that a friend of theirs, C.T.Schmitz, had recently died of cancer. He was only fifteen years old. He had gone to school with a lot of the teenagers who were there that day and each of them had memories of a boy sweeter than any they had known. His friend Kevin had decided to put this car wash together because he wanted to honor his friend and also bring together his classmates with his boy scout troop . He told me that they wanted to plant a tree in front of their school and if they raised enough money they would put a plaque  there also. Both would be in memory of their friend C.T.\nThey handed me a bag of homemade cookies with my receipt  saying\"Thanks for helping us plant a tree of C.T.\"\nYeah! I don't know what is with teenagers today!\n\nQuestion:\nWhat would be the best title for the passage?\n\nOptions:\nA: Teenagers Today\nB: A Special Day\nC: My view on Teenagers\nD: An Exciting Experience\n\n\nYour Answer:", "role": "user", "name": null, "raw": false}], "model": "rwkv", "stream": false, "stop": ["\n\nUser", "\n\nQuestion", "\n\nQ", "\n\nHuman", "\n\nBob", "\n\nAssistant", "\n\nAnswer", "\n\nA", "\n\nBot", "\n\nAlice", "\n\nObservation", "\n\nUser", "\n\nAss"], "tools": null, "tool_choice": "auto", "user_name": null, "assistant_name": null, "system_name": null, "presystem": false}

### FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES (DO NOT ANSWER) ###

--- EXAMPLE 1 (DO NOT ANSWER) START ---
Passage:
Last week I talked with some of my students about what they wanted to do after they graduated, and what kind of job prospects  they thought they had.
Given that I teach students who are training to be doctors, I was surprised do find that most thought that they would not be able to get the jobs they wanted without "outside help". "What kind of help is that?" I asked, expecting them to tell me that they would need a   or family friend to help them out.
"Surgery ," one replied.
I was pretty alarmed by that response. It seems that the graduates of today are increasingly willing to go under the knife to get ahead of others when it comes to getting a job .
One girl told me that she was considering surgery to increase her height. "They break your legs, put in special extending screws, and slowly expand the gap between the two ends of the bone as it re-grows, you can get at least 5 cm taller!"
At that point, I was shocked. I am short, I can't deny that, but I don't think I would put myself through months of agony just to be a few centimetres taller. I don't even bother to wear shoes with thick soles, as I'm not trying to hide the fact that I am just not tall!
It seems to me that there is a trend towards wanting "perfection" , and that is an ideal that just does not exist in reality.

### FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES (DO NOT ANSWER) ###

--- EXAMPLE 1 (DO NOT ANSWER) START ---
Passage:
Last week I talked with some of my students about what they wanted to do after they graduated, and what kind of job prospects  they thought they had.
Given that I teach students who are training to be doctors, I was surprised do find that most thought that they would not be able to get the jobs they wanted without "outside help". "What kind of help is that?" I asked, expecting them to tell me that they would need a   or family friend to help them out.
"Surgery ," one replied.
I was pretty alarmed by that response. It seems that the graduates of today are increasingly willing to go under the knife to get ahead of others when it comes to getting a job .
One girl told me that she was considering surgery to increase her height. "They break your legs, put in special extending screws, and slowly expand the gap between the two ends of the bone as it re-grows, you can get at least 5 cm taller!"
At that point, I was shocked. I am short, I can't deny that, but I don't think I would put myself through months of agony just to be a few centimetres taller. I don't even bother to wear shoes with thick soles, as I'm not trying to hide the fact that I am just not tall!
It seems to me that there is a trend towards wanting "perfection" , and that is an ideal that just does not exist in reality.
No one is born perfect, yet magazines, TV shows and movies present images of thin, tall, beautiful people as being the norm. Advertisements for slimming aids, beauty treatments and cosmetic surgery clinics fill the pages of newspapers, further creating an idea that "perfection" is a requirement, and that it must be purchased, no matter what the cost. In my opinion, skills, rather than appearance, should determine how successful a person is in his/her chosen career.

### FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES (DO NOT ANSWER) ###

--- EXAMPLE 1 (DO NOT ANSWER) START ---
Passage:
Last week I talked with some of my students about what they wanted to do after they graduated, and what kind of job prospects  they thought they had.
Given that I teach students who are training to be doctors, I was surprised do find that most thought that they would not be able to get the jobs they wanted without "outside help". "What kind of help is that?" I asked, expecting them to tell me that they would need a   or family friend to help them out.
"Surgery ," one replied.
I was pretty alarmed by that response. It seems that the graduates of today are increasingly willing to go under the knife to get ahead of others when it comes to getting a job .
One girl told me that she was considering surgery to increase her height. "They break your legs, put in special extending screws, and slowly expand the gap between the two ends of the bone as it re-grows, you can get at least 5 cm taller!"
At that point, I was shocked. I am short, I can't deny that, but I don't think I would put myself through months of agony just to be a few centimetres taller. I don't even bother to wear shoes with thick soles, as I'm not trying to hide the fact that I am just not tall!
It seems to me that there is a trend towards wanting "perfection" , and that is an ideal that just does not exist in reality.
No one is born perfect, yet magazines, TV shows and movies present images of thin, tall, beautiful people as being the norm. Advertisements for slimming aids, beauty treatments and cosmetic surgery clinics fill the pages of newspapers, further creating an idea that "perfection" is a requirement, and that it must be purchased, no matter what the cost. In my opinion, skills, rather than appearance, should determine how successful a person is in his/her chosen career.

### FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES (DO NOT ANSWER) ###

--- EXAMPLE 1 (DO NOT ANSWER) START ---
Passage:
Last week I talked with some of my students about what they wanted to do after they graduated, and what kind of job prospects  they thought they had.
Given that I teach students who are training to be doctors, I was surprised do find that most thought that they would not be able to get the jobs they wanted without "outside help". "What kind of help is that?" I asked, expecting them to tell me that they would need a   or family friend to help them out.
"Surgery ," one replied.
I was pretty alarmed by that response. It seems that the graduates of today are increasingly willing to go under the knife to get ahead of others when it comes to getting a job .
One girl told me that she was considering surgery to increase her height. "They break your legs, put in special extending screws, and slowly expand the gap between the two ends of the bone as it re-grows, you can get at least 5 cm taller!"
At that point, I was shocked. I am short, I can't deny that, but I don't think I would put myself through months of agony just to be a few centimetres taller. I don't even bother to wear shoes with thick soles, as I'm not trying to hide the fact that I am just not tall!
It seems to me that there is a trend towards wanting "perfection" , and that is an ideal that just does not exist in reality.
No one is born perfect, yet magazines, TV shows and movies present images of thin, tall, beautiful people as being the norm. Advertisements for slimming aids, beauty treatments and cosmetic surgery clinics fill the pages of newspapers, further creating an idea that "perfection" is a requirement, and that it must be purchased, no matter what the cost. In my opinion, skills, rather than appearance, should determine how successful a person is in his/her chosen career.

There were sixty children, aged three to six, in the Children's House. The rooms were bright and color1ful. Maria let the children make their own choice of what they wanted to do and work with their own speed. They became busy, peaceful and happy.
  Maria Montessori was one of the world's great teachers. She traveled in Europe, Americaand Far East. She thought that true education, providing  for the real needs of the child, would produce wise and happy grown-ups and therefore a peaceful world. Her original way of education has changed our whole idea of what childhood is.
  Maria Montessori died in Hollandat the age of eighty-two.

### FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES (DO NOT ANSWER) ###

--- EXAMPLE 1 (DO NOT ANSWER) START ---
Passage:
Last week I talked with some of my students about what they wanted to do after they graduated, and what kind of job prospects  they thought they had.
Given that I teach students who are training to be doctors, I was surprised do find that most thought that they would not be able to get the jobs they wanted without "outside help". "What kind of help is that?" I asked, expecting them to tell me that they would need a   or family friend to help them out.
"Surgery ," one replied.
I was pretty alarmed by that response. It seems that the graduates of today are increasingly willing to go under the knife to get ahead of others when it comes to getting a job .
One girl told me that she was considering surgery to increase her height. "They break your legs, put in special extending screws, and slowly expand the gap between the two ends of the bone as it re-grows, you can get at least 5 cm taller!"
At that point, I was shocked. I am short, I can't deny that, but I don't think I would put myself through months of agony just to be a few centimetres taller. I don't even bother to wear shoes with thick soles, as I'm not trying to hide the fact that I am just not tall!
It seems to me that there is a trend towards wanting "perfection" , and that is an ideal that just does not exist in reality.
No one is born perfect, yet magazines, TV shows and movies present images of thin, tall, beautiful people as being the norm. Advertisements for slimming aids, beauty treatments and cosmetic surgery clinics fill the pages of newspapers, further creating an idea that "perfection" is a requirement, and that it must be purchased, no matter what the cost. In my opinion, skills, rather than appearance, should determine how successful a person is in his/her chosen career.

Passage:
Last week I talked with some of my students about what they wanted to do after they graduated, and what kind of job prospects  they thought they had.

### REAL QUESTION — ANSWER THIS ONLY ###
Passage:
The child of today owes much of its pleasant school life to the work of Maria Montessori and others who felt as she did.
 Maria Montessori was born in 1870 in northern prefix = st1 /Italy. Both her parents were well educated.
 While Maria was a student, she took great interest in the study of the particular nature of the child's mind. It came to her that small children should have freedom  to learn.
 Maria became a doctor and a professor at RomeUniversity. In 1907, after working with backward students, she was given a chance to try out her ideas on children. There were sixty children, aged three to six, in the Children's House. The rooms were bright and color1ful. Maria let the children make their own choice of what they wanted to do and work with their own speed. They became busy, peaceful and happy.
  Maria Montessori was one of the world's great teachers. She traveled in Europe, Americaand Far East. She thought that true education, providing  for the real needs of the child, would produce wise and happy grown-ups and therefore a peaceful world. Her original way of education has changed our whole idea of what childhood is.
  Maria Montessori died in Hollandat the age of eighty-two.

"Surgery ," one replied.
I was pretty alarmed by that response. It seems that the graduates of today are increasingly willing to go under the knife to get ahead of others when it comes to getting a job .
One girl told me that she was considering surgery to increase her height. "They break your legs, put in special extending screws, and slowly expand the gap between the two ends of the bone as it re-grows, you can get at least 5 cm taller!"
At that point, I was shocked. I am short, I can't deny that, but I don't think I would put myself through months of agony just to be a few centimetres taller. I don't even bother to wear shoes with thick soles, as I'm not trying to hide the fact that I am just not tall!

### REAL QUESTION — ANSWER THIS ONLY ###
Passage:
The child of today owes much of its pleasant school life to the work of Maria Montessori and others who felt as she did.
 Maria Montessori was born in 1870 in northern prefix = st1 /Italy. Both her parents were well educated.
 While Maria was a student, she took great interest in the study of the particular nature of the child's mind. It came to her that small children should have freedom  to learn.
 Maria became a doctor and a professor at RomeUniversity. In 1907, after working with backward students, she was given a chance to try out her ideas on children. There were sixty children, aged three to six, in the Children's House. The rooms were bright and color1ful. Maria let the children make their own choice of what they wanted to do and work with their own speed. They became busy, peaceful and happy.
  Maria Montessori was one of the world's great teachers. She traveled in Europe, Americaand Far East. She thought that true education, providing  for the real needs of the child, would produce wise and happy grown-ups and therefore a peaceful world. Her original way of education has changed our whole idea of what childhood is.
  Maria Montessori died in Hollandat the age of eighty-two.

Options:
A: She taught them the best way of learning well.
B: She let them learn in a very pleasant way.

Passage:
Last week I talked with some of my students about what they wanted to do after they graduated, and what kind of job prospects  they thought they had.
Given that I teach students who are training to be doctors, I was surprised do find that most thought that they would not be able to get the jobs they wanted without "outside help". "What kind of help is that?" I asked, expecting them to tell me that they would need a   or family friend to help them out.
"Surgery ," one replied.
I was pretty alarmed by that response. It seems that the graduates of today are increasingly willing to go under the knife to get ahead of others when it comes to getting a job .
One girl told me that she was considering surgery to increase her height. "They break your legs, put in special extending screws, and slowly expand the gap between the two ends of the bone as it re-grows, you can get at least 5 cm taller!"

### FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES (DO NOT ANSWER) ###

--- EXAMPLE 1 (DO NOT ANSWER) START ---
Passage:
Last week I talked with some of my students about what they wanted to do after they graduated, and what kind of job prospects  they thought they had.
Given that I teach students who are training to be doctors, I was surprised do find that most thought that they would not be able to get the jobs they wanted without "outside help". "What kind of help is that?" I asked, expecting them to tell me that they would need a   or family friend to help them out.
"Surgery ," one replied.
I was pretty alarmed by that response. It seems that the graduates of today are increasingly willing to go under the knife to get ahead of others when it comes to getting a job .
One girl told me that she was considering surgery to increase her height. "They break your legs, put in special extending screws, and slowly expand the gap between the two ends of the bone as it re-grows, you can get at least 5 cm taller!"
At that point, I was shocked. I am short, I can't deny that, but I don't think I would put myself through months of agony just to be a few centimetres taller. I don't even bother to wear shoes with thick soles, as I'm not trying to hide the fact that I am just not tall!
It seems to me that there is a trend towards wanting "perfection" , and that is an ideal that just does not exist in reality.

Passage:
Last week I talked with some of my students about what they wanted to do after they graduated, and what kind of job prospects  they thought they had.
Given that I teach students who are training to be doctors, I was surprised do find that most thought that they would not be able to get the jobs they wanted without "outside help". "What kind of help is that?" I asked, expecting them to tell me that they would need a   or family friend to help them out.
"Surgery ," one replied.
I was pretty alarmed by that response. It seems that the graduates of today are increasingly willing to go under the knife to get ahead of others when it comes to getting a job .
One girl told me that she was considering surgery to increase her height. "They break your legs, put in special extending screws, and slowly expand the gap between the two ends of the bone as it re-grows, you can get at least 5 cm taller!"
At that point, I was shocked. I am short, I can't deny that, but I don't think I would put myself through months of agony just to be a few centimetres taller. I don't even bother to wear shoes with thick soles, as I'm not trying to hide the fact that I am just not tall!
It seems to me that there is a trend towards wanting "perfection" , and that is an ideal that just does not exist in reality.

### FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES (DO NOT ANSWER) ###

--- EXAMPLE 1 (DO NOT ANSWER) START ---
Passage:
Last week I talked with some of my students about what they wanted to do after they graduated, and what kind of job prospects  they thought they had.
Given that I teach students who are training to be doctors, I was surprised do find that most thought that they would not be able to get the jobs they wanted without "outside help". "What kind of help is that?" I asked, expecting them to tell me that they would need a   or family friend to help them out.
"Surgery ," one replied.
I was pretty alarmed by that response. It seems that the graduates of today are increasingly willing to go under the knife to get ahead of others when it comes to getting a job .
One girl told me that she was considering surgery to increase her height. "They break your legs, put in special extending screws, and slowly expand the gap between the two ends of the bone as it re-grows, you can get at least 5 cm taller!"
At that point, I was shocked. I am short, I can't deny that, but I don't think I would put myself through months of agony just to be a few centimetres taller. I don't even bother to wear shoes with thick soles, as I'm not trying to hide the fact that I am just not tall!
It seems to me that there is a trend towards wanting "perfection" , and that is an ideal that just does not exist in reality.
No one is born perfect, yet magazines, TV shows and movies present images of thin, tall, beautiful people as being the norm. Advertisements for slimming aids, beauty treatments and cosmetic surgery clinics fill the pages of newspapers, further creating an idea that "perfection" is a requirement, and that it must be purchased, no matter what the cost. In my opinion, skills, rather than appearance, should determine how successful a person is in his/her chosen career.

He can carry a tank of air on his back and breathe through a nose and a mouthpiece. Water weighs 800 times as much as air. Tons of water pushes against a diver deep in the sea. His body is under great pressure.
When a diver is under great pressure, his blood takes in some of the gases he breathes. As he rises to surface, the water pressure becomes less. If the diver rises too quickly, the gases in his blood form bubbles. The diver is then suffering from the bends. The bends can cause a diver to double up in pain. They can even kill him.

### FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES (DO NOT ANSWER) ###

--- EXAMPLE 1 (DO NOT ANSWER) START ---
Passage:
Last week I talked with some of my students about what they wanted to do after they graduated, and what kind of job prospects  they thought they had.
Given that I teach students who are training to be doctors, I was surprised do find that most thought that they would not be able to get the jobs they wanted without "outside help". "What kind of help is that?" I asked, expecting them to tell me that they would need a   or family friend to help them out.
"Surgery ," one replied.
I was pretty alarmed by that response. It seems that the graduates of today are increasingly willing to go under the knife to get ahead of others when it comes to getting a job .
One girl told me that she was considering surgery to increase her height. "They break your legs, put in special extending screws, and slowly expand the gap between the two ends of the bone as it re-grows, you can get at least 5 cm taller!"
At that point, I was shocked. I am short, I can't deny that, but I don't think I would put myself through months of agony just to be a few centimetres taller. I don't even bother to wear shoes with thick soles, as I'm not trying to hide the fact that I am just not tall!
It seems to me that there is a trend towards wanting "perfection" , and that is an ideal that just does not exist in reality.
No one is born perfect, yet magazines, TV shows and movies present images of thin, tall, beautiful people as being the norm. Advertisements for slimming aids, beauty treatments and cosmetic surgery clinics fill the pages of newspapers, further creating an idea that "perfection" is a requirement, and that it must be purchased, no matter what the cost. In my opinion, skills, rather than appearance, should determine how successful a person is in his/her chosen career.

### REAL QUESTION — ANSWER THIS ONLY ###
Passage:
The sea has always interested man. From it he can get food, minerals, and treasure. For thousands of years, he could sail on it. But he could not go far beneath its surface.
Man wants to explore deep into the sea. However, he is not a fish. He must breathe air, so he can't stay under the water's surface for any length of time. To explore deep water, man faces even more dangers and problems.
A diver who wants to stay under water for more than a few minutes must breathe air or a special mixture of gases. He can wear a diving suit and have air pumped to him from above. He can carry a tank of air on his back and breathe through a nose and a mouthpiece. Water weighs 800 times as much as air. Tons of water pushes against a diver deep in the sea. His body is under great pressure.
When a diver is under great pressure, his blood takes in some of the gases he breathes. As he rises to surface, the water pressure becomes less. If the diver rises too quickly, the gases in his blood form bubbles. The diver is then suffering from the bends. The bends can cause a diver to double up in pain. They can even kill him.

Question:
From the passage we can see that   _  .

Options:
A: the sea began to interest man a few years ago
B: man is not at home deep in the sea
C: all divers will get the bends sooner or later
D: the air in the sea water will kill a diver if he is not careful

The treaty would be signed in 2015 and take effect after 2020.\\n    In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency is leading government efforts to fight climate change.

### FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES (DO NOT ANSWER) ###

--- EXAMPLE 1 (DO NOT ANSWER) START ---
Passage:
Last week I talked with some of my students about what they wanted to do after they graduated, and what kind of job prospects  they thought they had.
Given that I teach students who are training to be doctors, I was surprised do find that most thought that they would not be able to get the jobs they wanted without "outside help". "What kind of help is that?" I asked, expecting them to tell me that they would need a   or family friend to help them out.
"Surgery ," one replied.
I was pretty alarmed by that response. It seems that the graduates of today are increasingly willing to go under the knife to get ahead of others when it comes to getting a job .
One girl told me that she was considering surgery to increase her height. "They break your legs, put in special extending screws, and slowly expand the gap between the two ends of the bone as it re-grows, you can get at least 5 cm taller!"
At that point, I was shocked. I am short, I can't deny that, but I don't think I would put myself through months of agony just to be a few centimetres taller. I don't even bother to wear shoes with thick soles, as I'm not trying to hide the fact that I am just not tall!
It seems to me that there is a trend towards wanting "perfection" , and that is an ideal that just does not exist in reality.
No one is born perfect, yet magazines, TV shows and movies present images of thin, tall, beautiful people as being the norm. Advertisements for slimming aids, beauty treatments and cosmetic surgery clinics fill the pages of newspapers, further creating an idea that "perfection" is a requirement, and that it must be purchased, no matter what the cost. In my opinion, skills, rather than appearance, should determine how successful a person is in his/her chosen career.

Question:

Options:
A: doctor
B: model
C: teacher

### REAL QUESTION — ANSWER THIS ONLY ###
Passage:
Experts from nearly 200 countries have spent the past two weeks in Warsaw, Poland. More than 9, 000 representatives gathered for a United Nations conference on climate change. Organizers called the meeting to work toward a treaty to fight rising temperatures on our planet. The treaty would be signed in 2015 and take effect after 2020.
    In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency is leading government efforts to fight climate change. The agency just ended a series of public hearings across the country. The EPA was seeking comments as it considers tightening clean air rules for coal burning power plants.
    David Doniger is a climate policy expert. He says it is the duty of the EPA to control carbon as a pollutant. He wants the agency to establish new rules that would move the United States toward a cleaner energy environment.
     "No one is coming up with standards that would knock out all those power plants. We're   talking about a shift from the dirtier ones to the cleaner ones, and from all those fossil fuel- powered ones towards renewable and even nuclear sources of energy. "
    He says the government is responsible for protecting clean air ,not protecting old and dirty  power stations. He says, "That's the only way that we can continue to have the way of life we want without running into the wall on climate change impacts, which in turn will destroy the quality of life we have."
    The EPA is now considering comments from the nationwide hearings. The agency plans to announce proposed rule changes in June.

Question:
The United Nations conference was held to   _  .

Options:
A: gather opinions from the representatives
B: make plans for nearly 200 countries
C: deal with the warming climate
D: call for protection of wildlife

### FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES (DO NOT ANSWER) ###

--- EXAMPLE 1 (DO NOT ANSWER) START ---
Passage:
Last week I talked with some of my students about what they wanted to do after they graduated, and what kind of job prospects  they thought they had.
Given that I teach students who are training to be doctors, I was surprised do find that most thought that they would not be able to get the jobs they wanted without "outside help". "What kind of help is that?" I asked, expecting them to tell me that they would need a   or family friend to help them out.
"Surgery ," one replied.
I was pretty alarmed by that response. It seems that the graduates of today are increasingly willing to go under the knife to get ahead of others when it comes to getting a job .
One girl told me that she was considering surgery to increase her height. "They break your legs, put in special extending screws, and slowly expand the gap between the two ends of the bone as it re-grows, you can get at least 5 cm taller!"
At that point, I was shocked. I am short, I can't deny that, but I don't think I would put myself through months of agony just to be a few centimetres taller. I don't even bother to wear shoes with thick soles, as I'm not trying to hide the fact that I am just not tall!
It seems to me that there is a trend towards wanting "perfection" , and that is an ideal that just does not exist in reality.

Advertisements for slimming aids, beauty treatments and cosmetic surgery clinics fill the pages of newspapers, further creating an idea that "perfection" is a requirement, and that it must be purchased, no matter what the cost. In my opinion, skills, rather than appearance, should determine how successful a person is in his/her chosen career.

Last week I talked with some of my students about what they wanted to do after they graduated, and what kind of job prospects  they thought they had.
Given that I teach students who are training to be doctors, I was surprised do find that most thought that they would not be able to get the jobs they wanted without "outside help". "What kind of help is that?" I asked, expecting them to tell me that they would need a   or family friend to help them out.
"Surgery ," one replied.
I was pretty alarmed by that response. It seems that the graduates of today are increasingly willing to go under the knife to get ahead of others when it comes to getting a job .
One girl told me that she was considering surgery to increase her height. "They break your legs, put in special extending screws, and slowly expand the gap between the two ends of the bone as it re-grows, you can get at least 5 cm taller!"
At that point, I was shocked. I am short, I can't deny that, but I don't think I would put myself through months of agony just to be a few centimetres taller. I don't even bother to wear shoes with thick soles, as I'm not trying to hide the fact that I am just not tall!
It seems to me that there is a trend towards wanting "perfection" , and that is an ideal that just does not exist in reality.
No one is born perfect, yet magazines, TV shows and movies present images of thin, tall, beautiful people as being the norm. Advertisements for slimming aids, beauty treatments and cosmetic surgery clinics fill the pages of newspapers, further creating an idea that "perfection" is a requirement, and that it must be purchased, no matter what the cost. In my opinion, skills, rather than appearance, should determine how successful a person is in his/her chosen career.

Question:
According to the passage, the author believes that_.

Options:
A: everyone should purchase perfection, whatever the cost
B: it's right for graduates to ask for others to help them out in hunting for jobs
C: it is one's appearance instead of skills that really matters in one's career
D: media are to blame for misleading young people in their seeking for surgery

Correct Answer: D

### REAL QUESTION — ANSWER THIS ONLY ###
Passage:
Experts from nearly 200 countries have spent the past two weeks in Warsaw, Poland. More than 9, 000 representatives gathered for a United Nations conference on climate change. Organizers called the meeting to work toward a treaty to fight rising temperatures on our planet. The treaty would be signed in 2015 and take effect after 2020.
    In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency is leading government efforts to fight climate change. The agency just ended a series of public hearings across the country. The EPA was seeking comments as it considers tightening clean air rules for coal burning power plants.
    David Doniger is a climate policy expert. He says it is the duty of the EPA to control carbon as a pollutant. He wants the agency to establish new rules that would move the United States toward a cleaner energy environment.
     "No one is coming up with standards that would knock out all those power plants. We're   talking about a shift from the dirtier ones to the cleaner ones, and from all those fossil fuel- powered ones towards renewable and even nuclear sources of energy. "
    He says the government is responsible for protecting clean air ,not protecting old and dirty  power stations. He says, "That's the only way that we can continue to have the way of life we want without running into the wall on climate change impacts, which in turn will destroy the quality of life we have."
    The EPA is now considering comments from the nationwide hearings. The agency plans to announce proposed rule changes in June.

Question:
What action will the EPA take to fight climate change?

Options:
A: Make more strict rules to limit coal power plants.
B: Develop more nuclear sources of energy.
C: Accept the opinions of the Americans.
D: Close those power plants which pollute the air most.

### REAL QUESTION — ANSWER THIS ONLY ###
Passage:
As the pace of life continues to increase, we are fast losing the art of relaxation. Once you are in the habit of rushing through life,being on the go from morning till night,it is hard to slow down. But relaxation is necessary for a healthy mind and body.
Stress is a natural part of everyday life and there is no way to avoid it. In fact,it is not the bad thing it is often supposed to be. A certain amount of stress is vital to provide motivation and give purpose to life. It is only when the stress gets out of control that it can lead to poor performance and ill health.
The amount of stress a person can bear depends very much on the individual. Some people are not afraid of stressand such characters are obviously important material for managerial responsibilities. Others lose heart at the first signs of unusual difficulties. When exposed to stressin whatever formwe react both chemically and physically. In fact we make choices between "fight" and "flight" and in more ancient days the choice made the difference between life and death. The crises  we meet today are unlikely to be so extreme,but however little the stress,it involves the same response. It is when _ lasts long,through continued exposure to stressthat health becomes endangered. Such serious conditions as high blood pressure and heart disease have established links with stress. Since we cannot remove stress from our lives(it would be unwise to do so even if we could),we need to find ways to deal with it.

### FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES (DO NOT ANSWER) ###

--- EXAMPLE 1 (DO NOT ANSWER) START ---
Passage:
Last week I talked with some of my students about what they wanted to do after they graduated, and what kind of job prospects  they thought they had.
Given that I teach students who are training to be doctors, I was surprised do find that most thought that they would not be able to get the jobs they wanted without "outside help". "What kind of help is that?" I asked, expecting them to tell me that they would need a   or family friend to help them out.
"Surgery ," one replied.
I was pretty alarmed by that response. It seems that the graduates of today are increasingly willing to go under the knife to get ahead of others when it comes to getting a job .
One girl told me that she was considering surgery to increase her height. "They break your legs, put in special extending screws, and slowly expand the gap between the two ends of the bone as it re-grows, you can get at least 5 cm taller!"
At that point, I was shocked. I am short, I can't deny that, but I don't think I would put myself through months of agony just to be a few centimetres taller. I don't even bother to wear shoes with thick soles, as I'm not trying to hide the fact that I am just not tall!
It seems to me that there is a trend towards wanting "perfection" , and that is an ideal that just does not exist in reality.

### FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES (DO NOT ANSWER) ###

--- EXAMPLE 1 (DO NOT ANSWER) START ---
Passage:
Last week I talked with some of my students about what they wanted to do after they graduated, and what kind of job prospects  they thought they had.
Given that I teach students who are training to be doctors, I was surprised do find that most thought that they would not be able to get the jobs they wanted without "outside help". "What kind of help is that?" I asked, expecting them to tell me that they would need a   or family friend to help them out.
"Surgery ," one replied.
I was pretty alarmed by that response. It seems that the graduates of today are increasingly willing to go under the knife to get ahead of others when it comes to getting a job .
One girl told me that she was considering surgery to increase her height. "They break your legs, put in special extending screws, and slowly expand the gap between the two ends of the bone as it re-grows, you can get at least 5 cm taller!"
At that point, I was shocked. I am short, I can't deny that, but I don't think I would put myself through months of agony just to be a few centimetres taller. I don't even bother to wear shoes with thick soles, as I'm not trying to hide the fact that I am just not tall!
It seems to me that there is a trend towards wanting "perfection" , and that is an ideal that just does not exist in reality.

### REAL QUESTION — ANSWER THIS ONLY ###
Passage:
As the pace of life continues to increase, we are fast losing the art of relaxation. Once you are in the habit of rushing through life,being on the go from morning till night,it is hard to slow down. But relaxation is necessary for a healthy mind and body.
Stress is a natural part of everyday life and there is no way to avoid it. In fact,it is not the bad thing it is often supposed to be. A certain amount of stress is vital to provide motivation and give purpose to life. It is only when the stress gets out of control that it can lead to poor performance and ill health.
The amount of stress a person can bear depends very much on the individual. Some people are not afraid of stressand such characters are obviously important material for managerial responsibilities. Others lose heart at the first signs of unusual difficulties. When exposed to stressin whatever formwe react both chemically and physically. In fact we make choices between "fight" and "flight" and in more ancient days the choice made the difference between life and death. The crises  we meet today are unlikely to be so extreme,but however little the stress,it involves the same response. It is when _ lasts long,through continued exposure to stressthat health becomes endangered. Such serious conditions as high blood pressure and heart disease have established links with stress. Since we cannot remove stress from our lives(it would be unwise to do so even if we could),we need to find ways to deal with it.

### FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES (DO NOT ANSWER) ###

--- EXAMPLE 1 (DO NOT ANSWER) START ---
Passage:
Last week I talked with some of my students about what they wanted to do after they graduated, and what kind of job prospects  they thought they had.
Given that I teach students who are training to be doctors, I was surprised do find that most thought that they would not be able to get the jobs they wanted without "outside help". "What kind of help is that?" I asked, expecting them to tell me that they would need a   or family friend to help them out.
"Surgery ," one replied.
I was pretty alarmed by that response. It seems that the graduates of today are increasingly willing to go under the knife to get ahead of others when it comes to getting a job .
One girl told me that she was considering surgery to increase her height. "They break your legs, put in special extending screws, and slowly expand the gap between the two ends of the bone as it re-grows, you can get at least 5 cm taller!"
At that point, I was shocked. I am short, I can't deny that, but I don't think I would put myself through months of agony just to be a few centimetres taller. I don't even bother to wear shoes with thick soles, as I'm not trying to hide the fact that I am just not tall!
It seems to me that there is a trend towards wanting "perfection" , and that is an ideal that just does not exist in reality.
No one is born perfect, yet magazines, TV shows and movies present images of thin, tall, beautiful people as being the norm. Advertisements for slimming aids, beauty treatments and cosmetic surgery clinics fill the pages of newspapers, further creating an idea that "perfection" is a requirement, and that it must be purchased, no matter what the cost. In my opinion, skills, rather than appearance, should determine how successful a person is in his/her chosen career.

### FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES (DO NOT ANSWER) ###

--- EXAMPLE 1 (DO NOT ANSWER) START ---
Passage:
Last week I talked with some of my students about what they wanted to do after they graduated, and what kind of job prospects  they thought they had.
Given that I teach students who are training to be doctors, I was surprised do find that most thought that they would not be able to get the jobs they wanted without "outside help". "What kind of help is that?" I asked, expecting them to tell me that they would need a   or family friend to help them out.
"Surgery ," one replied.
I was pretty alarmed by that response. It seems that the graduates of today are increasingly willing to go under the knife to get ahead of others when it comes to getting a job .
One girl told me that she was considering surgery to increase her height. "They break your legs, put in special extending screws, and slowly expand the gap between the two ends of the bone as it re-grows, you can get at least 5 cm taller!"
At that point, I was shocked. I am short, I can't deny that, but I don't think I would put myself through months of agony just to be a few centimetres taller. I don't even bother to wear shoes with thick soles, as I'm not trying to hide the fact that I am just not tall!
It seems to me that there is a trend towards wanting "perfection" , and that is an ideal that just does not exist in reality.
No one is born perfect, yet magazines, TV shows and movies present images of thin, tall, beautiful people as being the norm. Advertisements for slimming aids, beauty treatments and cosmetic surgery clinics fill the pages of newspapers, further creating an idea that "perfection" is a requirement, and that it must be purchased, no matter what the cost. In my opinion, skills, rather than appearance, should determine how successful a person is in his/her chosen career.

### FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES (DO NOT ANSWER) ###

--- EXAMPLE 1 (DO NOT ANSWER) START ---
Passage:
Last week I talked with some of my students about what they wanted to do after they graduated, and what kind of job prospects  they thought they had.
Given that I teach students who are training to be doctors, I was surprised do find that most thought that they would not be able to get the jobs they wanted without "outside help". "What kind of help is that?" I asked, expecting them to tell me that they would need a   or family friend to help them out.
"Surgery ," one replied.
I was pretty alarmed by that response. It seems that the graduates of today are increasingly willing to go under the knife to get ahead of others when it comes to getting a job .
One girl told me that she was considering surgery to increase her height. "They break your legs, put in special extending screws, and slowly expand the gap between the two ends of the bone as it re-grows, you can get at least 5 cm taller!"
At that point, I was shocked. I am short, I can't deny that, but I don't think I would put myself through months of agony just to be a few centimetres taller. I don't even bother to wear shoes with thick soles, as I'm not trying to hide the fact that I am just not tall!
It seems to me that there is a trend towards wanting "perfection" , and that is an ideal that just does not exist in reality.
No one is born perfect, yet magazines, TV shows and movies present images of thin, tall, beautiful people as being the norm. Advertisements for slimming aids, beauty treatments and cosmetic surgery clinics fill the pages of newspapers, further creating an idea that "perfection" is a requirement, and that it must be purchased, no matter what the cost. In my opinion, skills, rather than appearance, should determine how successful a person is in his/her chosen career.

### FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES (DO NOT ANSWER) ###

--- EXAMPLE 1 (DO NOT ANSWER) START ---
Passage:
Last week I talked with some of my students about what they wanted to do after they graduated, and what kind of job prospects  they thought they had.
Given that I teach students who are training to be doctors, I was surprised do find that most thought that they would not be able to get the jobs they wanted without "outside help". "What kind of help is that?" I asked, expecting them to tell me that they would need a   or family friend to help them out.
"Surgery ," one replied.
I was pretty alarmed by that response. It seems that the graduates of today are increasingly willing to go under the knife to get ahead of others when it comes to getting a job .
One girl told me that she was considering surgery to increase her height. "They break your legs, put in special extending screws, and slowly expand the gap between the two ends of the bone as it re-grows, you can get at least 5 cm taller!"
At that point, I was shocked. I am short, I can't deny that, but I don't think I would put myself through months of agony just to be a few centimetres taller. I don't even bother to wear shoes with thick soles, as I'm not trying to hide the fact that I am just not tall!
It seems to me that there is a trend towards wanting "perfection" , and that is an ideal that just does not exist in reality.
No one is born perfect, yet magazines, TV shows and movies present images of thin, tall, beautiful people as being the norm. Advertisements for slimming aids, beauty treatments and cosmetic surgery clinics fill the pages of newspapers, further creating an idea that "perfection" is a requirement, and that it must be purchased, no matter what the cost. In my opinion, skills, rather than appearance, should determine how successful a person is in his/her chosen career.

### REAL QUESTION — ANSWER THIS ONLY ###
Passage:
The deadliest Ebola outbreak in history that has so far killed almost 1000 people in Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Nigeria in West Africa has caused fear around the world.
The outbreak is unprecedented both in infection numbers and in geographic scope. Officials from the World Health Organization (WHO) said earlier this month the outbreak "is moving faster than our efforts to control it", reported CNN. So far, the battle against the virus doesn't appear to be slowing down.
The Ebola virus is terrifying no matter where it strikes: It's a disease with no cure that causes headaches and fever, severe diarrhea , vomiting and bleeding and has been known to kill up to 90 percent of its victims.
It is understandable for people to be panicked, but those living outside Africa shouldn't be particularly concerned about contracting the virus, says aWashington Postarticle.
This is because transmission of Ebola requires direct contact with an infected person's blood, vomit or other bodily fluids during the period that he or she is contagious . It is something that is extremely unlikely for anyone but healthcare workers. The virus is not spread by coughing or sneezing.
Media outlets in the US and the UK are using terrifying headlines, wrongly claiming that people infected with the virus have traveled to their countries.
James Ball atThe Guardiansays the Ebola outbreak in Africa is tragic, but it is important to _ Other infectious diseases, including common influenza, are far, far deadlier.

Question:
What does the author say about the Ebola outbreak in West Africa?

Options:
A: It has caused thousands of African deaths.
B: Its spreading speed is beyond people's imagination.
C: It has already traveled to the US and the UK.
D: The fight against it is slowing down.

### FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES (DO NOT ANSWER) ###

--- EXAMPLE 1 (DO NOT ANSWER) START ---
Passage:
Last week I talked with some of my students about what they wanted to do after they graduated, and what kind of job prospects  they thought they had.
Given that I teach students who are training to be doctors, I was surprised do find that most thought that they would not be able to get the jobs they wanted without "outside help". "What kind of help is that?" I asked, expecting them to tell me that they would need a   or family friend to help them out.
"Surgery ," one replied.
I was pretty alarmed by that response. It seems that the graduates of today are increasingly willing to go under the knife to get ahead of others when it comes to getting a job .
One girl told me that she was considering surgery to increase her height. "They break your legs, put in special extending screws, and slowly expand the gap between the two ends of the bone as it re-grows, you can get at least 5 cm taller!"
At that point, I was shocked. I am short, I can't deny that, but I don't think I would put myself through months of agony just to be a few centimetres taller. I don't even bother to wear shoes with thick soles, as I'm not trying to hide the fact that I am just not tall!

Passage:
Last week I talked with some of my students about what they wanted to do after they graduated, and what kind of job prospects  they thought they had.
Given that I teach students who are training to be doctors, I was surprised do find that most thought that they would not be able to get the jobs they wanted without "outside help". "What kind of help is that?" I asked, expecting them to tell me that they would need a   or family friend to help them out.
"Surgery ," one replied.
I was pretty alarmed by that response. It seems that the graduates of today are increasingly willing to go under the knife to get ahead of others when it comes to getting a job .
One girl told me that she was considering surgery to increase her height. "They break your legs, put in special extending screws, and slowly expand the gap between the two ends of the bone as it re-grows, you can get at least 5 cm taller!"
At that point, I was shocked. I am short, I can't deny that, but I don't think I would put myself through months of agony just to be a few centimetres taller. I don't even bother to wear shoes with thick soles, as I'm not trying to hide the fact that I am just not tall!

### REAL QUESTION — ANSWER THIS ONLY ###
Passage:
The deadliest Ebola outbreak in history that has so far killed almost 1000 people in Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Nigeria in West Africa has caused fear around the world.
The outbreak is unprecedented both in infection numbers and in geographic scope. Officials from the World Health Organization (WHO) said earlier this month the outbreak "is moving faster than our efforts to control it", reported CNN. So far, the battle against the virus doesn't appear to be slowing down.
The Ebola virus is terrifying no matter where it strikes: It's a disease with no cure that causes headaches and fever, severe diarrhea , vomiting and bleeding and has been known to kill up to 90 percent of its victims.
It is understandable for people to be panicked, but those living outside Africa shouldn't be particularly concerned about contracting the virus, says aWashington Postarticle.
This is because transmission of Ebola requires direct contact with an infected person's blood, vomit or other bodily fluids during the period that he or she is contagious . It is something that is extremely unlikely for anyone but healthcare workers. The virus is not spread by coughing or sneezing.
Media outlets in the US and the UK are using terrifying headlines, wrongly claiming that people infected with the virus have traveled to their countries.
James Ball atThe Guardiansays the Ebola outbreak in Africa is tragic, but it is important to _ Other infectious diseases, including common influenza, are far, far deadlier.

Question:
The Ebola virus is terrifying because   _  .

Options:
A: it cannot be cured at the moment
B: it is easily infected
C: it spreads faster than any other infectious disease
D: it has caused more deaths than other infectious diseases

The outbreak is unprecedented both in infection numbers and in geographic scope. Officials from the World Health Organization (WHO) said earlier this month the outbreak "is moving faster than our efforts to control it", reported CNN. So far, the battle against the virus doesn't appear to be slowing down.
The Ebola virus is terrifying no matter where it strikes: It's a disease with no cure that causes headaches and fever, severe diarrhea , vomiting and bleeding and has been known to kill up to 90 percent of its victims.
It is understandable for people to be panicked, but those living outside Africa shouldn't be particularly concerned about contracting the virus, says aWashington Postarticle.
This is because transmission of Ebola requires direct contact with an infected person's blood, vomit or other bodily fluids during the period that he or she is contagious . It is something that is extremely unlikely for anyone but healthcare workers. The virus is not spread by coughing or sneezing.
Media outlets in the US and the UK are using terrifying headlines, wrongly claiming that people infected with the virus have traveled to their countries.
James Ball atThe Guardiansays the Ebola outbreak in Africa is tragic, but it is important to _ Other infectious diseases, including common influenza, are far, far deadlier.

Question:
What is the author's attitude towards people's panic?

Options:
A: Objective.
B: Supportive.
C: Doubtful.
D: Understandable.

### FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES (DO NOT ANSWER) ###

--- EXAMPLE 1 (DO NOT ANSWER) START ---
Passage:
Last week I talked with some of my students about what they wanted to do after they graduated, and what kind of job prospects  they thought they had.
Given that I teach students who are training to be doctors, I was surprised do find that most thought that they would not be able to get the jobs they wanted without "outside help". "What kind of help is that?" I asked, expecting them to tell me that they would need a   or family friend to help them out.
"Surgery ," one replied.
I was pretty alarmed by that response. It seems that the graduates of today are increasingly willing to go under the knife to get ahead of others when it comes to getting a job .
One girl told me that she was considering surgery to increase her height. "They break your legs, put in special extending screws, and slowly expand the gap between the two ends of the bone as it re-grows, you can get at least 5 cm taller!"
At that point, I was shocked. I am short, I can't deny that, but I don't think I would put myself through months of agony just to be a few centimetres taller. I don't even bother to wear shoes with thick soles, as I'm not trying to hide the fact that I am just not tall!

### FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES (DO NOT ANSWER) ###

--- EXAMPLE 1 (DO NOT ANSWER) START ---
Passage:
Last week I talked with some of my students about what they wanted to do after they graduated, and what kind of job prospects  they thought they had.
Given that I teach students who are training to be doctors, I was surprised do find that most thought that they would not be able to get the jobs they wanted without "outside help". "What kind of help is that?" I asked, expecting them to tell me that they would need a   or family friend to help them out.
"Surgery ," one replied.
I was pretty alarmed by that response. It seems that the graduates of today are increasingly willing to go under the knife to get ahead of others when it comes to getting a job .
One girl told me that she was considering surgery to increase her height. "They break your legs, put in special extending screws, and slowly expand the gap between the two ends of the bone as it re-grows, you can get at least 5 cm taller!"
At that point, I was shocked. I am short, I can't deny that, but I don't think I would put myself through months of agony just to be a few centimetres taller. I don't even bother to wear shoes with thick soles, as I'm not trying to hide the fact that I am just not tall!
It seems to me that there is a trend towards wanting "perfection" , and that is an ideal that just does not exist in reality.

### FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES (DO NOT ANSWER) ###

--- EXAMPLE 1 (DO NOT ANSWER) START ---
Passage:
Last week I talked with some of my students about what they wanted to do after they graduated, and what kind of job prospects  they thought they had.
Given that I teach students who are training to be doctors, I was surprised do find that most thought that they would not be able to get the jobs they wanted without "outside help". "What kind of help is that?" I asked, expecting them to tell me that they would need a   or family friend to help them out.
"Surgery ," one replied.
I was pretty alarmed by that response. It seems that the graduates of today are increasingly willing to go under the knife to get ahead of others when it comes to getting a job .
One girl told me that she was considering surgery to increase her height. "They break your legs, put in special extending screws, and slowly expand the gap between the two ends of the bone as it re-grows, you can get at least 5 cm taller!"
At that point, I was shocked. I am short, I can't deny that, but I don't think I would put myself through months of agony just to be a few centimetres taller. I don't even bother to wear shoes with thick soles, as I'm not trying to hide the fact that I am just not tall!
It seems to me that there is a trend towards wanting "perfection" , and that is an ideal that just does not exist in reality.

Advertisements for slimming aids, beauty treatments and cosmetic surgery clinics fill the pages of newspapers, further creating an idea that "perfection" is a requirement, and that it must be purchased, no matter what the cost. In my opinion, skills, rather than appearance, should determine how successful a person is in his/her chosen career.

### FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES (DO NOT ANSWER) ###

--- EXAMPLE 1 (DO NOT ANSWER) START ---
Passage:
Last week I talked with some of my students about what they wanted to do after they graduated, and what kind of job prospects  they thought they had.
Given that I teach students who are training to be doctors, I was surprised do find that most thought that they would not be able to get the jobs they wanted without "outside help". "What kind of help is that?" I asked, expecting them to tell me that they would need a   or family friend to help them out.
"Surgery ," one replied.
I was pretty alarmed by that response. It seems that the graduates of today are increasingly willing to go under the knife to get ahead of others when it comes to getting a job .
One girl told me that she was considering surgery to increase her height. "They break your legs, put in special extending screws, and slowly expand the gap between the two ends of the bone as it re-grows, you can get at least 5 cm taller!"
At that point, I was shocked. I am short, I can't deny that, but I don't think I would put myself through months of agony just to be a few centimetres taller. I don't even bother to wear shoes with thick soles, as I'm not trying to hide the fact that I am just not tall!
It seems to me that there is a trend towards wanting "perfection" , and that is an ideal that just does not exist in reality.

Advertisements for slimming aids, beauty treatments and cosmetic surgery clinics fill the pages of newspapers, further creating an idea that "perfection" is a requirement, and that it must be purchased, no matter what the cost. In my opinion, skills, rather than appearance, should determine how successful a person is in his/her chosen career.

### FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES (DO NOT ANSWER) ###

--- EXAMPLE 1 (DO NOT ANSWER) START ---
Passage:
Last week I talked with some of my students about what they wanted to do after they graduated, and what kind of job prospects  they thought they had.
Given that I teach students who are training to be doctors, I was surprised do find that most thought that they would not be able to get the jobs they wanted without "outside help". "What kind of help is that?" I asked, expecting them to tell me that they would need a   or family friend to help them out.
"Surgery ," one replied.
I was pretty alarmed by that response. It seems that the graduates of today are increasingly willing to go under the knife to get ahead of others when it comes to getting a job .
One girl told me that she was considering surgery to increase her height. "They break your legs, put in special extending screws, and slowly expand the gap between the two ends of the bone as it re-grows, you can get at least 5 cm taller!"
At that point, I was shocked. I am short, I can't deny that, but I don't think I would put myself through months of agony just to be a few centimetres taller. I don't even bother to wear shoes with thick soles, as I'm not trying to hide the fact that I am just not tall!
It seems to me that there is a trend towards wanting "perfection" , and that is an ideal that just does not exist in reality.

Passage:
Since we are social beings, the quality of our lives depends in large measure on our interpersonal  relationships. One strength of the human condition is our possibility to give and receive support from one another under stressful conditions. Social support makes up of the exchange of resources among people based on their interpersonal ties.

Social support cushions  stress in a number of ways. First, friends, relatives and co-workers may let us know that they value us.

Taking part in free-time activities with others helps us to meet our social needs while at the same time distracting   us from our worries and troubles. Finally, other people may give us instrumental support money aid, material resources, and needed services - that reduces stress by helping us resolve and deal with our problems.

### FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES (DO NOT ANSWER) ###

--- EXAMPLE 1 (DO NOT ANSWER) START ---
Passage:
Last week I talked with some of my students about what they wanted to do after they graduated, and what kind of job prospects  they thought they had.
Given that I teach students who are training to be doctors, I was surprised do find that most thought that they would not be able to get the jobs they wanted without "outside help". "What kind of help is that?" I asked, expecting them to tell me that they would need a   or family friend to help them out.
"Surgery ," one replied.
I was pretty alarmed by that response. It seems that the graduates of today are increasingly willing to go under the knife to get ahead of others when it comes to getting a job .
One girl told me that she was considering surgery to increase her height. "They break your legs, put in special extending screws, and slowly expand the gap between the two ends of the bone as it re-grows, you can get at least 5 cm taller!"
At that point, I was shocked. I am short, I can't deny that, but I don't think I would put myself through months of agony just to be a few centimetres taller. I don't even bother to wear shoes with thick soles, as I'm not trying to hide the fact that I am just not tall!
It seems to me that there is a trend towards wanting "perfection" , and that is an ideal that just does not exist in reality.
No one is born perfect, yet magazines, TV shows and movies present images of thin, tall, beautiful people as being the norm. Advertisements for slimming aids, beauty treatments and cosmetic surgery clinics fill the pages of newspapers, further creating an idea that "perfection" is a requirement, and that it must be purchased, no matter what the cost. In my opinion, skills, rather than appearance, should determine how successful a person is in his/her chosen career.

### REAL QUESTION — ANSWER THIS ONLY ###
Passage:
Since we are social beings, the quality of our lives depends in large measure on our interpersonal  relationships. One strength of the human condition is our possibility to give and receive support from one another under stressful conditions. Social support makes up of the exchange of resources among people based on their interpersonal ties. Those of us with strong support systems appear better able to deal with major life changes and daily problems. People with strong social ties live longer and have better health than those without such ties. Studies over types of illnesses, from depression to heart disease, show that the presence of social support helps people defend themselves against illness, and the absence of such support makes poor health more likely.
Social support cushions  stress in a number of ways. First, friends, relatives and co-workers may let us know that they value us. Our self-respect is strengthened when we feel accepted by others in spite of our faults and difficulties. Second, other people often provide us with informational support. They help us to define and understand our problems and find solutions to them. Third, we typically find social companionship supportive. Taking part in free-time activities with others helps us to meet our social needs while at the same time distracting   us from our worries and troubles. Finally, other people may give us instrumental support money aid, material resources, and needed services - that reduces stress by helping us resolve and deal with our problems.

Question:

Options:
A: lies in the social medical care systems which support them
B: has much to do with the amount of support they get from others

### FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES (DO NOT ANSWER) ###

--- EXAMPLE 1 (DO NOT ANSWER) START ---
Passage:
Last week I talked with some of my students about what they wanted to do after they graduated, and what kind of job prospects  they thought they had.
Given that I teach students who are training to be doctors, I was surprised do find that most thought that they would not be able to get the jobs they wanted without "outside help". "What kind of help is that?" I asked, expecting them to tell me that they would need a   or family friend to help them out.
"Surgery ," one replied.
I was pretty alarmed by that response. It seems that the graduates of today are increasingly willing to go under the knife to get ahead of others when it comes to getting a job .
One girl told me that she was considering surgery to increase her height. "They break your legs, put in special extending screws, and slowly expand the gap between the two ends of the bone as it re-grows, you can get at least 5 cm taller!"
At that point, I was shocked. I am short, I can't deny that, but I don't think I would put myself through months of agony just to be a few centimetres taller. I don't even bother to wear shoes with thick soles, as I'm not trying to hide the fact that I am just not tall!
It seems to me that there is a trend towards wanting "perfection" , and that is an ideal that just does not exist in reality.
No one is born perfect, yet magazines, TV shows and movies present images of thin, tall, beautiful people as being the norm. Advertisements for slimming aids, beauty treatments and cosmetic surgery clinics fill the pages of newspapers, further creating an idea that "perfection" is a requirement, and that it must be purchased, no matter what the cost. In my opinion, skills, rather than appearance, should determine how successful a person is in his/her chosen career.

### REAL QUESTION — ANSWER THIS ONLY ###
Passage:
Since we are social beings, the quality of our lives depends in large measure on our interpersonal  relationships. One strength of the human condition is our possibility to give and receive support from one another under stressful conditions. Social support makes up of the exchange of resources among people based on their interpersonal ties. Those of us with strong support systems appear better able to deal with major life changes and daily problems. People with strong social ties live longer and have better health than those without such ties. Studies over types of illnesses, from depression to heart disease, show that the presence of social support helps people defend themselves against illness, and the absence of such support makes poor health more likely.
Social support cushions  stress in a number of ways. First, friends, relatives and co-workers may let us know that they value us. Our self-respect is strengthened when we feel accepted by others in spite of our faults and difficulties. Second, other people often provide us with informational support. They help us to define and understand our problems and find solutions to them. Third, we typically find social companionship supportive. Taking part in free-time activities with others helps us to meet our social needs while at the same time distracting   us from our worries and troubles. Finally, other people may give us instrumental support money aid, material resources, and needed services - that reduces stress by helping us resolve and deal with our problems.

Question:
Helping a sick neighbor with some repair work in spare time is an example of   _

Options:
A: instrumental support
B: informational support
C: social companionship
D: the strengthening of self-respect

### FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES (DO NOT ANSWER) ###

--- EXAMPLE 1 (DO NOT ANSWER) START ---
Passage:
Last week I talked with some of my students about what they wanted to do after they graduated, and what kind of job prospects  they thought they had.
Given that I teach students who are training to be doctors, I was surprised do find that most thought that they would not be able to get the jobs they wanted without "outside help". "What kind of help is that?" I asked, expecting them to tell me that they would need a   or family friend to help them out.
"Surgery ," one replied.
I was pretty alarmed by that response. It seems that the graduates of today are increasingly willing to go under the knife to get ahead of others when it comes to getting a job .
One girl told me that she was considering surgery to increase her height. "They break your legs, put in special extending screws, and slowly expand the gap between the two ends of the bone as it re-grows, you can get at least 5 cm taller!"
At that point, I was shocked. I am short, I can't deny that, but I don't think I would put myself through months of agony just to be a few centimetres taller. I don't even bother to wear shoes with thick soles, as I'm not trying to hide the fact that I am just not tall!
It seems to me that there is a trend towards wanting "perfection" , and that is an ideal that just does not exist in reality.
No one is born perfect, yet magazines, TV shows and movies present images of thin, tall, beautiful people as being the norm. Advertisements for slimming aids, beauty treatments and cosmetic surgery clinics fill the pages of newspapers, further creating an idea that "perfection" is a requirement, and that it must be purchased, no matter what the cost. In my opinion, skills, rather than appearance, should determine how successful a person is in his/her chosen career.

Passage:
Last week I talked with some of my students about what they wanted to do after they graduated, and what kind of job prospects  they thought they had.
Given that I teach students who are training to be doctors, I was surprised do find that most thought that they would not be able to get the jobs they wanted without "outside help". "What kind of help is that?" I asked, expecting them to tell me that they would need a   or family friend to help them out.
"Surgery ," one replied.
I was pretty alarmed by that response. It seems that the graduates of today are increasingly willing to go under the knife to get ahead of others when it comes to getting a job .
One girl told me that she was considering surgery to increase her height. "They break your legs, put in special extending screws, and slowly expand the gap between the two ends of the bone as it re-grows, you can get at least 5 cm taller!"
At that point, I was shocked. I am short, I can't deny that, but I don't think I would put myself through months of agony just to be a few centimetres taller. I don't even bother to wear shoes with thick soles, as I'm not trying to hide the fact that I am just not tall!
It seems to me that there is a trend towards wanting "perfection" , and that is an ideal that just does not exist in reality.
No one is born perfect, yet magazines, TV shows and movies present images of thin, tall, beautiful people as being the norm. Advertisements for slimming aids, beauty treatments and cosmetic surgery clinics fill the pages of newspapers, further creating an idea that "perfection" is a requirement, and that it must be purchased, no matter what the cost. In my opinion, skills, rather than appearance, should determine how successful a person is in his/her chosen career.

Question:
Many graduates today turn to cosmetic surgery to_.

Options:
A: marry a better man/woman
B: become a model
C: get an advantage over others in job-hunting
D: attract more admirers

### REAL QUESTION — ANSWER THIS ONLY ###
Passage:
Since we are social beings, the quality of our lives depends in large measure on our interpersonal  relationships. One strength of the human condition is our possibility to give and receive support from one another under stressful conditions. Social support makes up of the exchange of resources among people based on their interpersonal ties. Those of us with strong support systems appear better able to deal with major life changes and daily problems. People with strong social ties live longer and have better health than those without such ties. Studies over types of illnesses, from depression to heart disease, show that the presence of social support helps people defend themselves against illness, and the absence of such support makes poor health more likely.
Social support cushions  stress in a number of ways. First, friends, relatives and co-workers may let us know that they value us. Our self-respect is strengthened when we feel accepted by others in spite of our faults and difficulties. Second, other people often provide us with informational support. They help us to define and understand our problems and find solutions to them. Third, we typically find social companionship supportive. Taking part in free-time activities with others helps us to meet our social needs while at the same time distracting   us from our worries and troubles. Finally, other people may give us instrumental support money aid, material resources, and needed services - that reduces stress by helping us resolve and deal with our problems.

Question:
What is the subject discussed in the text?

Options:
A: Effects of stressful condition.
B: Kinds of social support.
C: Ways to deal with stress.
D: Interpersonal relationships.

One\'s own plans, reports of analyses may be looked through in detail---perhaps even challenged---by a young person. This is not to be considered a loss of face; nor is it a sign of \\"no confidence\\". Our whole approach to research is different. Your ideas are being looked at, not you yourself. To us the two are quite separate. This is the way our mind work. We are seeking facts; we are not challenging you as a person. So, too, even in social conversation you will find that people often argue, pick an idea apart, ask for your sources or challenge your conclusions.

Passage:
Last week I talked with some of my students about what they wanted to do after they graduated, and what kind of job prospects  they thought they had.
Given that I teach students who are training to be doctors, I was surprised do find that most thought that they would not be able to get the jobs they wanted without "outside help". "What kind of help is that?" I asked, expecting them to tell me that they would need a   or family friend to help them out.
"Surgery ," one replied.
I was pretty alarmed by that response. It seems that the graduates of today are increasingly willing to go under the knife to get ahead of others when it comes to getting a job .
One girl told me that she was considering surgery to increase her height. "They break your legs, put in special extending screws, and slowly expand the gap between the two ends of the bone as it re-grows, you can get at least 5 cm taller!"
At that point, I was shocked. I am short, I can't deny that, but I don't think I would put myself through months of agony just to be a few centimetres taller. I don't even bother to wear shoes with thick soles, as I'm not trying to hide the fact that I am just not tall!

### REAL QUESTION — ANSWER THIS ONLY ###
Passage:
In much of the world, authority   is not challenged either out of respect or out of fear, sometimes, too, because a hierarchy   of rank has been fixed for so long that people have been trained for generations never to challenge it.
In such countries children are not expected to question their teachers in school, and young scholars or inventive industrial talents are hampered in technical research because they hesitate to disagree with their "superiors". Clever researchers may be considered too young to have "any right" to present findings that do not agree with knowledge and wisdom of their elders.
The American is trained from children to question, analyze and search. "Go look it up for yourself", a child will be told. School tasks are designed to demand the use of a wide range of materials. An assignment to "write a paper on the world's supply of sugar" will send even a young child in search of completely unfamiliar ideas. Even in the primary grades, children are taught to use libraries, and to search for new ideas. By the time they are 14, 15, and 16, many young scholars are making original and valuable contributions in all fields of science. Industry is so aware of this resource that each year, through national competitions, it offers tremendous awards among teenagers to seek out the brilliant minds across the country.
As seen by members of other nations, this emphasis on questioning and searching is bad for young people's "manners". Foreigners often feel great "lack of respect" in our youth. Foreign visitors are often surprised and frequently annoyed to find junior staff members "daring" to challenge older ones or argue points with them; they do not always like it when these young men make detailed but often revolutionary suggestions. One's own plans, reports of analyses may be looked through in detail---perhaps even challenged---by a young person. This is not to be considered a loss of face; nor is it a sign of "no confidence". Our whole approach to research is different. Your ideas are being looked at, not you yourself. To us the two are quite separate. This is the way our mind work. We are seeking facts; we are not challenging you as a person. So, too, even in social conversation you will find that people often argue, pick an idea apart, ask for your sources or challenge your conclusions. They do not mean to be rude; they are keenly interested and merely trying to explore the idea in greater depth.

Question:
What is the writer's attitude toward "hierarchy of rank"?

Options:
A: Supportive

### FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES (DO NOT ANSWER) ###

--- EXAMPLE 1 (DO NOT ANSWER) START ---
Passage:
Last week I talked with some of my students about what they wanted to do after they graduated, and what kind of job prospects  they thought they had.
Given that I teach students who are training to be doctors, I was surprised do find that most thought that they would not be able to get the jobs they wanted without "outside help". "What kind of help is that?" I asked, expecting them to tell me that they would need a   or family friend to help them out.
"Surgery ," one replied.
I was pretty alarmed by that response. It seems that the graduates of today are increasingly willing to go under the knife to get ahead of others when it comes to getting a job .
One girl told me that she was considering surgery to increase her height. "They break your legs, put in special extending screws, and slowly expand the gap between the two ends of the bone as it re-grows, you can get at least 5 cm taller!"
At that point, I was shocked. I am short, I can't deny that, but I don't think I would put myself through months of agony just to be a few centimetres taller. I don't even bother to wear shoes with thick soles, as I'm not trying to hide the fact that I am just not tall!
It seems to me that there is a trend towards wanting "perfection" , and that is an ideal that just does not exist in reality.

In my opinion, skills, rather than appearance, should determine how successful a person is in his/her chosen career.

They do not mean to be rude; they are keenly interested and merely trying to explore the idea in greater depth.

### FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES (DO NOT ANSWER) ###

--- EXAMPLE 1 (DO NOT ANSWER) START ---
Passage:
Last week I talked with some of my students about what they wanted to do after they graduated, and what kind of job prospects  they thought they had.
Given that I teach students who are training to be doctors, I was surprised do find that most thought that they would not be able to get the jobs they wanted without "outside help". "What kind of help is that?" I asked, expecting them to tell me that they would need a   or family friend to help them out.
"Surgery ," one replied.
I was pretty alarmed by that response. It seems that the graduates of today are increasingly willing to go under the knife to get ahead of others when it comes to getting a job .
One girl told me that she was considering surgery to increase her height. "They break your legs, put in special extending screws, and slowly expand the gap between the two ends of the bone as it re-grows, you can get at least 5 cm taller!"
At that point, I was shocked. I am short, I can't deny that, but I don't think I would put myself through months of agony just to be a few centimetres taller. I don't even bother to wear shoes with thick soles, as I'm not trying to hide the fact that I am just not tall!
It seems to me that there is a trend towards wanting "perfection" , and that is an ideal that just does not exist in reality.

### REAL QUESTION — ANSWER THIS ONLY ###
Passage:
In much of the world, authority   is not challenged either out of respect or out of fear, sometimes, too, because a hierarchy   of rank has been fixed for so long that people have been trained for generations never to challenge it.
In such countries children are not expected to question their teachers in school, and young scholars or inventive industrial talents are hampered in technical research because they hesitate to disagree with their "superiors". Clever researchers may be considered too young to have "any right" to present findings that do not agree with knowledge and wisdom of their elders.
The American is trained from children to question, analyze and search. "Go look it up for yourself", a child will be told. School tasks are designed to demand the use of a wide range of materials. An assignment to "write a paper on the world's supply of sugar" will send even a young child in search of completely unfamiliar ideas. Even in the primary grades, children are taught to use libraries, and to search for new ideas. By the time they are 14, 15, and 16, many young scholars are making original and valuable contributions in all fields of science. Industry is so aware of this resource that each year, through national competitions, it offers tremendous awards among teenagers to seek out the brilliant minds across the country.
As seen by members of other nations, this emphasis on questioning and searching is bad for young people's "manners". Foreigners often feel great "lack of respect" in our youth. Foreign visitors are often surprised and frequently annoyed to find junior staff members "daring" to challenge older ones or argue points with them; they do not always like it when these young men make detailed but often revolutionary suggestions. One's own plans, reports of analyses may be looked through in detail---perhaps even challenged---by a young person. This is not to be considered a loss of face; nor is it a sign of "no confidence". Our whole approach to research is different. Your ideas are being looked at, not you yourself. To us the two are quite separate. This is the way our mind work. We are seeking facts; we are not challenging you as a person. So, too, even in social conversation you will find that people often argue, pick an idea apart, ask for your sources or challenge your conclusions. They do not mean to be rude; they are keenly interested and merely trying to explore the idea in greater depth.

Question:
What is the main idea of the text?

Options:
A: It's necessary to respect superiors and elders.
B: Even authority can make mistakes sometimes.
C: American school education is quite successful.
D: Americans are trained to challenge authority.

Clever researchers may be considered too young to have \"any right\" to present findings that do not agree with knowledge and wisdom of their elders.\nThe American is trained from children to question, analyze and search. \"Go look it up for yourself\", a child will be told. School tasks are designed to demand the use of a wide range of materials. An assignment to \"write a paper on the world's supply of sugar\" will send even a young child in search of completely unfamiliar ideas. Even in the primary grades, children are taught to use libraries, and to search for new ideas. By the time they are 14, 15, and 16, many young scholars are making original and valuable contributions in all fields of science. Industry is so aware of this resource that each year, through national competitions, it offers tremendous awards among teenagers to seek out the brilliant minds across the country.\nAs seen by members of other nations, this emphasis on questioning and searching is bad for young people's \"manners\". Foreigners often feel great \"lack of respect\" in our youth. Foreign visitors are often surprised and frequently annoyed to find junior staff members \"daring\" to challenge older ones or argue points with them; they do not always like it when these young men make detailed but often revolutionary suggestions. One's own plans, reports of analyses may be looked through in detail---perhaps even challenged---by a young person. This is not to be considered a loss of face; nor is it a sign of \"no confidence\". Our whole approach to research is different. Your ideas are being looked at, not you yourself. To us the two are quite separate. This is the way our mind work. We are seeking facts; we are not challenging you as a person. So, too, even in social conversation you will find that people often argue, pick an idea apart, ask for your sources or challenge your conclusions. They do not mean to be rude; they are keenly interested and merely trying to explore the idea in greater depth.\n\nQuestion:\nWhat is the main idea of the text?\n\nOptions:\nA: It's necessary to respect superiors and elders.\nB: Even authority can make mistakes sometimes.\nC: American school education is quite successful.\nD: Americans are trained to challenge authority.\n\n\nYour Answer:", "role": "user", "name": null, "raw": false}], "model": "rwkv", "stream": false, "stop": ["\n\nUser", "\n\nQuestion", "\n\nQ", "\n\nHuman", "\n\nBob", "\n\nAssistant", "\n\nAnswer", "\n\nA", "\n\nBot", "\n\nAlice", "\n\nObservation", "\n\nUser", "\n\nAss"], "tools": null, "tool_choice": "auto", "user_name": null, "assistant_name": null, "system_name": null, "presystem": false}

### FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES (DO NOT ANSWER) ###

--- EXAMPLE 1 (DO NOT ANSWER) START ---
Passage:
Last week I talked with some of my students about what they wanted to do after they graduated, and what kind of job prospects  they thought they had.
Given that I teach students who are training to be doctors, I was surprised do find that most thought that they would not be able to get the jobs they wanted without "outside help". "What kind of help is that?" I asked, expecting them to tell me that they would need a   or family friend to help them out.
"Surgery ," one replied.
I was pretty alarmed by that response. It seems that the graduates of today are increasingly willing to go under the knife to get ahead of others when it comes to getting a job .
One girl told me that she was considering surgery to increase her height. "They break your legs, put in special extending screws, and slowly expand the gap between the two ends of the bone as it re-grows, you can get at least 5 cm taller!"
At that point, I was shocked. I am short, I can't deny that, but I don't think I would put myself through months of agony just to be a few centimetres taller. I don't even bother to wear shoes with thick soles, as I'm not trying to hide the fact that I am just not tall!
It seems to me that there is a trend towards wanting "perfection" , and that is an ideal that just does not exist in reality.

Advertisements for slimming aids, beauty treatments and cosmetic surgery clinics fill the pages of newspapers, further creating an idea that "perfection" is a requirement, and that it must be purchased, no matter what the cost. In my opinion, skills, rather than appearance, should determine how successful a person is in his/her chosen career.

### REAL QUESTION — ANSWER THIS ONLY ###
Passage:
Millions of kids in the United States attend some kind of camp each summer. Some go to sleep-away camp for weeks, while others attend day camp in their hometowns. There is one thing all those camps have in common, though. More than nine out of 10 kids said camp helped them make new friends and feel better about themselves.
 _ 
What else do kids get out of camp? Plenty!
Kids who want to be stars on the football field or basketball court have their choice of a variety of summer camps. Some, such as the Let Me Play sessions offered by Nike, are free and provide a few hours of instruction by professional athletes. Other summer sports camp opportunities are offered by professional teams or university athletic departments. Players and coaches usually lead those camps, teaching basic skills as well as teamwork and good sports behavior.
Open up to fun
It's easy to be yourself if you have something in common with your fellow campers, even when that something is a disease.
A journal entry by one camper describes the camp's high ropes course as a symbol of everyone there and the challenges they face. "Climbing it and going through that struggle to get up and push yourself is like getting through the sickness we all were faced with at some point," she writes. There is another reward that comes once climbers reach the top of the ropes course and hear the words "good job" from their fellow campers. It is, "in a way, coming close to being cured. Even if we aren't, it felt like it," the camper says.
Healthy benefits
There are also health and wellness camps for kids who don't have any illnesses. For Erin H. of Oklahoma, the first thoughts she had about going to a weight-loss camp were that it would be embarrassing and a waste of time. But as soon as she arrived at Wellspring Adventure Camp, she knew it would be awesome. "I had the most fun ever!" says Erin, who liked Wellspring so much. She stayed for eight weeks instead of the four weeks she'd originally agreed to. "This camp has helped improve my self-respect 100 percent, and I'm no longer self-conscious."

### FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES (DO NOT ANSWER) ###

--- EXAMPLE 1 (DO NOT ANSWER) START ---
Passage:
Last week I talked with some of my students about what they wanted to do after they graduated, and what kind of job prospects  they thought they had.
Given that I teach students who are training to be doctors, I was surprised do find that most thought that they would not be able to get the jobs they wanted without "outside help". "What kind of help is that?" I asked, expecting them to tell me that they would need a   or family friend to help them out.
"Surgery ," one replied.
I was pretty alarmed by that response. It seems that the graduates of today are increasingly willing to go under the knife to get ahead of others when it comes to getting a job .
One girl told me that she was considering surgery to increase her height. "They break your legs, put in special extending screws, and slowly expand the gap between the two ends of the bone as it re-grows, you can get at least 5 cm taller!"
At that point, I was shocked. I am short, I can't deny that, but I don't think I would put myself through months of agony just to be a few centimetres taller. I don't even bother to wear shoes with thick soles, as I'm not trying to hide the fact that I am just not tall!
It seems to me that there is a trend towards wanting "perfection" , and that is an ideal that just does not exist in reality.

Advertisements for slimming aids, beauty treatments and cosmetic surgery clinics fill the pages of newspapers, further creating an idea that "perfection" is a requirement, and that it must be purchased, no matter what the cost. In my opinion, skills, rather than appearance, should determine how successful a person is in his/her chosen career.

### REAL QUESTION — ANSWER THIS ONLY ###
Passage:
Millions of kids in the United States attend some kind of camp each summer. Some go to sleep-away camp for weeks, while others attend day camp in their hometowns. There is one thing all those camps have in common, though. More than nine out of 10 kids said camp helped them make new friends and feel better about themselves.
 _ 
What else do kids get out of camp? Plenty!
Kids who want to be stars on the football field or basketball court have their choice of a variety of summer camps. Some, such as the Let Me Play sessions offered by Nike, are free and provide a few hours of instruction by professional athletes. Other summer sports camp opportunities are offered by professional teams or university athletic departments. Players and coaches usually lead those camps, teaching basic skills as well as teamwork and good sports behavior.
Open up to fun
It's easy to be yourself if you have something in common with your fellow campers, even when that something is a disease.
A journal entry by one camper describes the camp's high ropes course as a symbol of everyone there and the challenges they face. "Climbing it and going through that struggle to get up and push yourself is like getting through the sickness we all were faced with at some point," she writes. There is another reward that comes once climbers reach the top of the ropes course and hear the words "good job" from their fellow campers. It is, "in a way, coming close to being cured. Even if we aren't, it felt like it," the camper says.
Healthy benefits
There are also health and wellness camps for kids who don't have any illnesses. For Erin H. of Oklahoma, the first thoughts she had about going to a weight-loss camp were that it would be embarrassing and a waste of time. But as soon as she arrived at Wellspring Adventure Camp, she knew it would be awesome. "I had the most fun ever!" says Erin, who liked Wellspring so much. She stayed for eight weeks instead of the four weeks she'd originally agreed to. "This camp has helped improve my self-respect 100 percent, and I'm no longer self-conscious."

Question:
The author mentioned the example of high ropes course to prove  _  .

Options:
A: it was an effective way to cure campers' illness
B: it had campers know the difficulty to fight against illness
C: it made campers realize the importance of health
D: it helped campers feel better about their illness

Even if we aren't, it felt like it,\" the camper says.\nHealthy benefits\nThere are also health and wellness camps for kids who don't have any illnesses. For Erin H. of Oklahoma, the first thoughts she had about going to a weight-loss camp were that it would be embarrassing and a waste of time. But as soon as she arrived at Wellspring Adventure Camp, she knew it would be awesome. \"I had the most fun ever!\" says Erin, who liked Wellspring so much.

### FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES (DO NOT ANSWER) ###

--- EXAMPLE 1 (DO NOT ANSWER) START ---
Passage:
Last week I talked with some of my students about what they wanted to do after they graduated, and what kind of job prospects  they thought they had.
Given that I teach students who are training to be doctors, I was surprised do find that most thought that they would not be able to get the jobs they wanted without "outside help". "What kind of help is that?" I asked, expecting them to tell me that they would need a   or family friend to help them out.
"Surgery ," one replied.
I was pretty alarmed by that response. It seems that the graduates of today are increasingly willing to go under the knife to get ahead of others when it comes to getting a job .
One girl told me that she was considering surgery to increase her height. "They break your legs, put in special extending screws, and slowly expand the gap between the two ends of the bone as it re-grows, you can get at least 5 cm taller!"
At that point, I was shocked. I am short, I can't deny that, but I don't think I would put myself through months of agony just to be a few centimetres taller. I don't even bother to wear shoes with thick soles, as I'm not trying to hide the fact that I am just not tall!
It seems to me that there is a trend towards wanting "perfection" , and that is an ideal that just does not exist in reality.

Advertisements for slimming aids, beauty treatments and cosmetic surgery clinics fill the pages of newspapers, further creating an idea that "perfection" is a requirement, and that it must be purchased, no matter what the cost. In my opinion, skills, rather than appearance, should determine how successful a person is in his/her chosen career.

### REAL QUESTION — ANSWER THIS ONLY ###
Passage:
Millions of kids in the United States attend some kind of camp each summer. Some go to sleep-away camp for weeks, while others attend day camp in their hometowns. There is one thing all those camps have in common, though. More than nine out of 10 kids said camp helped them make new friends and feel better about themselves.
 _ 
What else do kids get out of camp? Plenty!
Kids who want to be stars on the football field or basketball court have their choice of a variety of summer camps. Some, such as the Let Me Play sessions offered by Nike, are free and provide a few hours of instruction by professional athletes. Other summer sports camp opportunities are offered by professional teams or university athletic departments. Players and coaches usually lead those camps, teaching basic skills as well as teamwork and good sports behavior.
Open up to fun
It's easy to be yourself if you have something in common with your fellow campers, even when that something is a disease.
A journal entry by one camper describes the camp's high ropes course as a symbol of everyone there and the challenges they face. "Climbing it and going through that struggle to get up and push yourself is like getting through the sickness we all were faced with at some point," she writes. There is another reward that comes once climbers reach the top of the ropes course and hear the words "good job" from their fellow campers. It is, "in a way, coming close to being cured. Even if we aren't, it felt like it," the camper says.
Healthy benefits
There are also health and wellness camps for kids who don't have any illnesses. For Erin H. of Oklahoma, the first thoughts she had about going to a weight-loss camp were that it would be embarrassing and a waste of time. But as soon as she arrived at Wellspring Adventure Camp, she knew it would be awesome. "I had the most fun ever!" says Erin, who liked Wellspring so much. She stayed for eight weeks instead of the four weeks she'd originally agreed to. "This camp has helped improve my self-respect 100 percent, and I'm no longer self-conscious."

Question:
The purpose of writing this passage is to   _  .

Options:
A: give advice on how to choose a suitable camp
B: compare sleep-away camps and day camps
C: advertise for some famous summer camps
D: introduce the benefits of going to a camp

Some go to sleep-away camp for weeks, while others attend day camp in their hometowns. There is one thing all those camps have in common, though. More than nine out of 10 kids said camp helped them make new friends and feel better about themselves.\n _ \nWhat else do kids get out of camp? Plenty!\nKids who want to be stars on the football field or basketball court have their choice of a variety of summer camps. Some, such as the Let Me Play sessions offered by Nike, are free and provide a few hours of instruction by professional athletes. Other summer sports camp opportunities are offered by professional teams or university athletic departments. Players and coaches usually lead those camps, teaching basic skills as well as teamwork and good sports behavior.\nOpen up to fun\nIt's easy to be yourself if you have something in common with your fellow campers, even when that something is a disease.\nA journal entry by one camper describes the camp's high ropes course as a symbol of everyone there and the challenges they face. \"Climbing it and going through that struggle to get up and push yourself is like getting through the sickness we all were faced with at some point,\" she writes. There is another reward that comes once climbers reach the top of the ropes course and hear the words \"good job\" from their fellow campers. It is, \"in a way, coming close to being cured. Even if we aren't, it felt like it,\" the camper says.\nHealthy benefits\nThere are also health and wellness camps for kids who don't have any illnesses. For Erin H. of Oklahoma, the first thoughts she had about going to a weight-loss camp were that it would be embarrassing and a waste of time. But as soon as she arrived at Wellspring Adventure Camp, she knew it would be awesome. \"I had the most fun ever!\" says Erin, who liked Wellspring so much. She stayed for eight weeks instead of the four weeks she'd originally agreed to. \"This camp has helped improve my self-respect 100 percent, and I'm no longer self-conscious.\"\n\nQuestion:\nThe purpose of writing this passage is to   _  .\n\nOptions:\nA: give advice on how to choose a suitable camp\nB: compare sleep-away camps and day camps\nC: advertise for some famous summer camps\nD: introduce the benefits of going to a camp\n\n\nYour Answer:", "role": "user", "name": null, "raw": false}], "model": "rwkv", "stream": false, "stop": ["\n\nUser", "\n\nQuestion", "\n\nQ", "\n\nHuman", "\n\nBob", "\n\nAssistant", "\n\nAnswer", "\n\nA", "\n\nBot", "\n\nAlice", "\n\nObservation", "\n\nUser", "\n\nAss"], "tools": null, "tool_choice": "auto", "user_name": null, "assistant_name": null, "system_name": null, "presystem": false}

### FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES (DO NOT ANSWER) ###

--- EXAMPLE 1 (DO NOT ANSWER) START ---
Passage:
Last week I talked with some of my students about what they wanted to do after they graduated, and what kind of job prospects  they thought they had.
Given that I teach students who are training to be doctors, I was surprised do find that most thought that they would not be able to get the jobs they wanted without "outside help". "What kind of help is that?" I asked, expecting them to tell me that they would need a   or family friend to help them out.
"Surgery ," one replied.
I was pretty alarmed by that response. It seems that the graduates of today are increasingly willing to go under the knife to get ahead of others when it comes to getting a job .
One girl told me that she was considering surgery to increase her height. "They break your legs, put in special extending screws, and slowly expand the gap between the two ends of the bone as it re-grows, you can get at least 5 cm taller!"
At that point, I was shocked. I am short, I can't deny that, but I don't think I would put myself through months of agony just to be a few centimetres taller. I don't even bother to wear shoes with thick soles, as I'm not trying to hide the fact that I am just not tall!
It seems to me that there is a trend towards wanting "perfection" , and that is an ideal that just does not exist in reality.
No one is born perfect, yet magazines, TV shows and movies present images of thin, tall, beautiful people as being the norm. Advertisements for slimming aids, beauty treatments and cosmetic surgery clinics fill the pages of newspapers, further creating an idea that "perfection" is a requirement, and that it must be purchased, no matter what the cost. In my opinion, skills, rather than appearance, should determine how successful a person is in his/her chosen career.

### REAL QUESTION — ANSWER THIS ONLY ###
Passage:
ChiChi weighs only 13 pounds. "He's so tiny,I can carry him with one hand," says Mary Lane."Most people see him and think he's useless."
But last October,ChiChi proved to be more than just a pretty face. Mary and her husband,Rick,were relaxing on the beach one afternoon while on vacation in North Carolina's Outer Banks.As usual,ChiChi was lying on his blanket in his own little beach chair.
"We had our noses buried in books,"recalls Rick,"when suddenly the dog became extremely uneasy. His bark was different from anything we had heard before.And he would not let us ignore him."
ChiChi ran back and forth in front of his chair as if to run down the beach.The Lanes sat up to see two elderly women in the ocean,about 100 yards down the beach and 10 feet off shore.One was on her back,her head under the waves.The other was struggling hard to keep her friend's head above the surface.
The Lanes rushed across the sand and into the surf. Rick went to the woman in danger of drowning,while Mary held fast on to the other one and pulled her up on the beach."Then I went back to help Rick," Mary says."The sand dropped off steeply,and a riptide was beating the woman under. She was completely helpless."
Not getting well from recent knee surgery,the woman had been unable to turn over or push herself up."Her friend had been in danger too," Mary says."The waves were pushing her around. There's no way she could have held on much longer."
The women hadn't called out for help. "They were struggling so hard that there was no time for screaming," Mary recalls."But ChiChi had sensed their danger."
Duty done,ChiChi was back in his chair,asleep,by the time the two women were on dry ground and the Lanes had returned to their blankets.Luckily,the women were fine,though shaken.They thanked the Lanes for saving their lives.
Back home in Greensboro,North Carolina,the Lanes ordered a special collar with the words "Hero Dog" on it.

Question:

### FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES (DO NOT ANSWER) ###

--- EXAMPLE 1 (DO NOT ANSWER) START ---
Passage:
Last week I talked with some of my students about what they wanted to do after they graduated, and what kind of job prospects  they thought they had.
Given that I teach students who are training to be doctors, I was surprised do find that most thought that they would not be able to get the jobs they wanted without "outside help". "What kind of help is that?" I asked, expecting them to tell me that they would need a   or family friend to help them out.
"Surgery ," one replied.
I was pretty alarmed by that response. It seems that the graduates of today are increasingly willing to go under the knife to get ahead of others when it comes to getting a job .
One girl told me that she was considering surgery to increase her height. "They break your legs, put in special extending screws, and slowly expand the gap between the two ends of the bone as it re-grows, you can get at least 5 cm taller!"
At that point, I was shocked. I am short, I can't deny that, but I don't think I would put myself through months of agony just to be a few centimetres taller. I don't even bother to wear shoes with thick soles, as I'm not trying to hide the fact that I am just not tall!
It seems to me that there is a trend towards wanting "perfection" , and that is an ideal that just does not exist in reality.

Advertisements for slimming aids, beauty treatments and cosmetic surgery clinics fill the pages of newspapers, further creating an idea that "perfection" is a requirement, and that it must be purchased, no matter what the cost. In my opinion, skills, rather than appearance, should determine how successful a person is in his/her chosen career.

### REAL QUESTION — ANSWER THIS ONLY ###
Passage:
ChiChi weighs only 13 pounds. "He's so tiny,I can carry him with one hand," says Mary Lane."Most people see him and think he's useless."
But last October,ChiChi proved to be more than just a pretty face. Mary and her husband,Rick,were relaxing on the beach one afternoon while on vacation in North Carolina's Outer Banks.As usual,ChiChi was lying on his blanket in his own little beach chair.
"We had our noses buried in books,"recalls Rick,"when suddenly the dog became extremely uneasy. His bark was different from anything we had heard before.And he would not let us ignore him."
ChiChi ran back and forth in front of his chair as if to run down the beach.The Lanes sat up to see two elderly women in the ocean,about 100 yards down the beach and 10 feet off shore.One was on her back,her head under the waves.The other was struggling hard to keep her friend's head above the surface.
The Lanes rushed across the sand and into the surf. Rick went to the woman in danger of drowning,while Mary held fast on to the other one and pulled her up on the beach."Then I went back to help Rick," Mary says."The sand dropped off steeply,and a riptide was beating the woman under. She was completely helpless."
Not getting well from recent knee surgery,the woman had been unable to turn over or push herself up."Her friend had been in danger too," Mary says."The waves were pushing her around. There's no way she could have held on much longer."
The women hadn't called out for help. "They were struggling so hard that there was no time for screaming," Mary recalls."But ChiChi had sensed their danger."
Duty done,ChiChi was back in his chair,asleep,by the time the two women were on dry ground and the Lanes had returned to their blankets.Luckily,the women were fine,though shaken.They thanked the Lanes for saving their lives.
Back home in Greensboro,North Carolina,the Lanes ordered a special collar with the words "Hero Dog" on it.

Question:

Options:
A: They were sleeping soundly.
B: They were absorbed in reading.
C: They were wiping their noses.
D: They were bathing in the sun.

### FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES (DO NOT ANSWER) ###

--- EXAMPLE 1 (DO NOT ANSWER) START ---
Passage:
Last week I talked with some of my students about what they wanted to do after they graduated, and what kind of job prospects  they thought they had.
Given that I teach students who are training to be doctors, I was surprised do find that most thought that they would not be able to get the jobs they wanted without "outside help". "What kind of help is that?" I asked, expecting them to tell me that they would need a   or family friend to help them out.
"Surgery ," one replied.
I was pretty alarmed by that response. It seems that the graduates of today are increasingly willing to go under the knife to get ahead of others when it comes to getting a job .
One girl told me that she was considering surgery to increase her height. "They break your legs, put in special extending screws, and slowly expand the gap between the two ends of the bone as it re-grows, you can get at least 5 cm taller!"
At that point, I was shocked. I am short, I can't deny that, but I don't think I would put myself through months of agony just to be a few centimetres taller. I don't even bother to wear shoes with thick soles, as I'm not trying to hide the fact that I am just not tall!
It seems to me that there is a trend towards wanting "perfection" , and that is an ideal that just does not exist in reality.

In my opinion, skills, rather than appearance, should determine how successful a person is in his/her chosen career.

Passage:
ChiChi weighs only 13 pounds. "He's so tiny,I can carry him with one hand," says Mary Lane."Most people see him and think he's useless."

The Lanes rushed across the sand and into the surf. Rick went to the woman in danger of drowning,while Mary held fast on to the other one and pulled her up on the beach."Then I went back to help Rick," Mary says."The sand dropped off steeply,and a riptide was beating the woman under. She was completely helpless."

### FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES (DO NOT ANSWER) ###

--- EXAMPLE 1 (DO NOT ANSWER) START ---
Passage:
Last week I talked with some of my students about what they wanted to do after they graduated, and what kind of job prospects  they thought they had.
Given that I teach students who are training to be doctors, I was surprised do find that most thought that they would not be able to get the jobs they wanted without "outside help". "What kind of help is that?" I asked, expecting them to tell me that they would need a   or family friend to help them out.
"Surgery ," one replied.
I was pretty alarmed by that response. It seems that the graduates of today are increasingly willing to go under the knife to get ahead of others when it comes to getting a job .
One girl told me that she was considering surgery to increase her height. "They break your legs, put in special extending screws, and slowly expand the gap between the two ends of the bone as it re-grows, you can get at least 5 cm taller!"
At that point, I was shocked. I am short, I can't deny that, but I don't think I would put myself through months of agony just to be a few centimetres taller. I don't even bother to wear shoes with thick soles, as I'm not trying to hide the fact that I am just not tall!
It seems to me that there is a trend towards wanting "perfection" , and that is an ideal that just does not exist in reality.
No one is born perfect, yet magazines, TV shows and movies present images of thin, tall, beautiful people as being the norm. Advertisements for slimming aids, beauty treatments and cosmetic surgery clinics fill the pages of newspapers, further creating an idea that "perfection" is a requirement, and that it must be purchased, no matter what the cost. In my opinion, skills, rather than appearance, should determine how successful a person is in his/her chosen career.

### REAL QUESTION — ANSWER THIS ONLY ###
Passage:
ChiChi weighs only 13 pounds. "He's so tiny,I can carry him with one hand," says Mary Lane."Most people see him and think he's useless."
But last October,ChiChi proved to be more than just a pretty face. Mary and her husband,Rick,were relaxing on the beach one afternoon while on vacation in North Carolina's Outer Banks.As usual,ChiChi was lying on his blanket in his own little beach chair.
"We had our noses buried in books,"recalls Rick,"when suddenly the dog became extremely uneasy. His bark was different from anything we had heard before.And he would not let us ignore him."
ChiChi ran back and forth in front of his chair as if to run down the beach.The Lanes sat up to see two elderly women in the ocean,about 100 yards down the beach and 10 feet off shore.One was on her back,her head under the waves.The other was struggling hard to keep her friend's head above the surface.
The Lanes rushed across the sand and into the surf. Rick went to the woman in danger of drowning,while Mary held fast on to the other one and pulled her up on the beach."Then I went back to help Rick," Mary says."The sand dropped off steeply,and a riptide was beating the woman under. She was completely helpless."
Not getting well from recent knee surgery,the woman had been unable to turn over or push herself up."Her friend had been in danger too," Mary says."The waves were pushing her around. There's no way she could have held on much longer."
The women hadn't called out for help. "They were struggling so hard that there was no time for screaming," Mary recalls."But ChiChi had sensed their danger."
Duty done,ChiChi was back in his chair,asleep,by the time the two women were on dry ground and the Lanes had returned to their blankets.Luckily,the women were fine,though shaken.They thanked the Lanes for saving their lives.
Back home in Greensboro,North Carolina,the Lanes ordered a special collar with the words "Hero Dog" on it.

Question:
Why couldn't the woman get out of the water?

Options:
A: She was bitten by a shark.
B: Her friend didn't offer help.
C: She was too weak to stay awake.
D: There was something wrong with her knee.

### FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES (DO NOT ANSWER) ###

--- EXAMPLE 1 (DO NOT ANSWER) START ---
Passage:
Last week I talked with some of my students about what they wanted to do after they graduated, and what kind of job prospects  they thought they had.
Given that I teach students who are training to be doctors, I was surprised do find that most thought that they would not be able to get the jobs they wanted without "outside help". "What kind of help is that?" I asked, expecting them to tell me that they would need a   or family friend to help them out.
"Surgery ," one replied.
I was pretty alarmed by that response. It seems that the graduates of today are increasingly willing to go under the knife to get ahead of others when it comes to getting a job .
One girl told me that she was considering surgery to increase her height. "They break your legs, put in special extending screws, and slowly expand the gap between the two ends of the bone as it re-grows, you can get at least 5 cm taller!"
At that point, I was shocked. I am short, I can't deny that, but I don't think I would put myself through months of agony just to be a few centimetres taller. I don't even bother to wear shoes with thick soles, as I'm not trying to hide the fact that I am just not tall!
It seems to me that there is a trend towards wanting "perfection" , and that is an ideal that just does not exist in reality.
No one is born perfect, yet magazines, TV shows and movies present images of thin, tall, beautiful people as being the norm. Advertisements for slimming aids, beauty treatments and cosmetic surgery clinics fill the pages of newspapers, further creating an idea that "perfection" is a requirement, and that it must be purchased, no matter what the cost. In my opinion, skills, rather than appearance, should determine how successful a person is in his/her chosen career.

### REAL QUESTION — ANSWER THIS ONLY ###
Passage:
ChiChi weighs only 13 pounds. "He's so tiny,I can carry him with one hand," says Mary Lane."Most people see him and think he's useless."
But last October,ChiChi proved to be more than just a pretty face. Mary and her husband,Rick,were relaxing on the beach one afternoon while on vacation in North Carolina's Outer Banks.As usual,ChiChi was lying on his blanket in his own little beach chair.
"We had our noses buried in books,"recalls Rick,"when suddenly the dog became extremely uneasy. His bark was different from anything we had heard before.And he would not let us ignore him."
ChiChi ran back and forth in front of his chair as if to run down the beach.The Lanes sat up to see two elderly women in the ocean,about 100 yards down the beach and 10 feet off shore.One was on her back,her head under the waves.The other was struggling hard to keep her friend's head above the surface.
The Lanes rushed across the sand and into the surf. Rick went to the woman in danger of drowning,while Mary held fast on to the other one and pulled her up on the beach."Then I went back to help Rick," Mary says."The sand dropped off steeply,and a riptide was beating the woman under. She was completely helpless."
Not getting well from recent knee surgery,the woman had been unable to turn over or push herself up."Her friend had been in danger too," Mary says."The waves were pushing her around. There's no way she could have held on much longer."
The women hadn't called out for help. "They were struggling so hard that there was no time for screaming," Mary recalls."But ChiChi had sensed their danger."
Duty done,ChiChi was back in his chair,asleep,by the time the two women were on dry ground and the Lanes had returned to their blankets.Luckily,the women were fine,though shaken.They thanked the Lanes for saving their lives.
Back home in Greensboro,North Carolina,the Lanes ordered a special collar with the words "Hero Dog" on it.

### FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES (DO NOT ANSWER) ###

--- EXAMPLE 1 (DO NOT ANSWER) START ---
Passage:
Last week I talked with some of my students about what they wanted to do after they graduated, and what kind of job prospects  they thought they had.
Given that I teach students who are training to be doctors, I was surprised do find that most thought that they would not be able to get the jobs they wanted without "outside help". "What kind of help is that?" I asked, expecting them to tell me that they would need a   or family friend to help them out.
"Surgery ," one replied.
I was pretty alarmed by that response. It seems that the graduates of today are increasingly willing to go under the knife to get ahead of others when it comes to getting a job .
One girl told me that she was considering surgery to increase her height. "They break your legs, put in special extending screws, and slowly expand the gap between the two ends of the bone as it re-grows, you can get at least 5 cm taller!"
At that point, I was shocked. I am short, I can't deny that, but I don't think I would put myself through months of agony just to be a few centimetres taller. I don't even bother to wear shoes with thick soles, as I'm not trying to hide the fact that I am just not tall!
It seems to me that there is a trend towards wanting "perfection" , and that is an ideal that just does not exist in reality.
No one is born perfect, yet magazines, TV shows and movies present images of thin, tall, beautiful people as being the norm. Advertisements for slimming aids, beauty treatments and cosmetic surgery clinics fill the pages of newspapers, further creating an idea that "perfection" is a requirement, and that it must be purchased, no matter what the cost. In my opinion, skills, rather than appearance, should determine how successful a person is in his/her chosen career.

### REAL QUESTION — ANSWER THIS ONLY ###
Passage:
Starting a new school term is always exciting. It is a chance to see all of your friends again. But most exciting of all, the new term is an opportunity to take up new hobbies. As you know, it is common in Britain for students to take up new hobbies after the Christmas holidays. Promising to begin something new is a common New Year resolution for many school teenagers.
Most schools offer different kinds of hobby classes. Students take them in their free periods or after school. Some classes you have to pay for and others are free of charge. For example, I once took a free Wednesday evening gymnastics class that my school offered. But when I learnt how to play the drum my parents had to pay for the lesson, and they did so, like most parents, without any complaint.
The most popular extra classes at my school were piano lessons and drama club:  Both classes offered exams students could take. Because the extra classes may take up much time of the students, students with many hobbies sometimes felt more stressed than those without any. But they could enjoy their life better than those who didn't foster   any hobbies at school. For example, they could build up good friendship with the persons who shared the common interest with them. Most important of all, the students with hobbies left school with many extra skills.
Frankly speaking, I haven't continued any of the hobbies I began at school. But I have never regretted taking them. After all, my best friend today is someone whom I met in my gymnastics class. The reason why we are still keeping in close touch with each other is that we have much in common.

Question:
The author's parents' attitude to hobby classes might be that of  _  .

Options:
A: approval
B: doubt
C: unconcern
D: disapproval

I was pretty alarmed by that response. It seems that the graduates of today are increasingly willing to go under the knife to get ahead of others when it comes to getting a job .
One girl told me that she was considering surgery to increase her height. "They break your legs, put in special extending screws, and slowly expand the gap between the two ends of the bone as it re-grows, you can get at least 5 cm taller!"
At that point, I was shocked. I am short, I can't deny that, but I don't think I would put myself through months of agony just to be a few centimetres taller. I don't even bother to wear shoes with thick soles, as I'm not trying to hide the fact that I am just not tall!
It seems to me that there is a trend towards wanting "perfection" , and that is an ideal that just does not exist in reality.
No one is born perfect, yet magazines, TV shows and movies present images of thin, tall, beautiful people as being the norm. Advertisements for slimming aids, beauty treatments and cosmetic surgery clinics fill the pages of newspapers, further creating an idea that "perfection" is a requirement, and that it must be purchased, no matter what the cost. In my opinion, skills, rather than appearance, should determine how successful a person is in his/her chosen career.

### REAL QUESTION — ANSWER THIS ONLY ###
Passage:
Starting a new school term is always exciting. It is a chance to see all of your friends again. But most exciting of all, the new term is an opportunity to take up new hobbies. As you know, it is common in Britain for students to take up new hobbies after the Christmas holidays. Promising to begin something new is a common New Year resolution for many school teenagers.
Most schools offer different kinds of hobby classes. Students take them in their free periods or after school. Some classes you have to pay for and others are free of charge. For example, I once took a free Wednesday evening gymnastics class that my school offered. But when I learnt how to play the drum my parents had to pay for the lesson, and they did so, like most parents, without any complaint.
The most popular extra classes at my school were piano lessons and drama club:  Both classes offered exams students could take. Because the extra classes may take up much time of the students, students with many hobbies sometimes felt more stressed than those without any. But they could enjoy their life better than those who didn't foster   any hobbies at school. For example, they could build up good friendship with the persons who shared the common interest with them. Most important of all, the students with hobbies left school with many extra skills.
Frankly speaking, I haven't continued any of the hobbies I began at school. But I have never regretted taking them. After all, my best friend today is someone whom I met in my gymnastics class. The reason why we are still keeping in close touch with each other is that we have much in common.

Question:
What is the biggest benefit children can get from taking up a new hobby?

Options:
A: They can enjoy a good time.
B: They can learn extra skills.
C: They can make more friends.
D: They will have things to share.

Passage:
Last week I talked with some of my students about what they wanted to do after they graduated, and what kind of job prospects  they thought they had.
Given that I teach students who are training to be doctors, I was surprised do find that most thought that they would not be able to get the jobs they wanted without "outside help". "What kind of help is that?" I asked, expecting them to tell me that they would need a   or family friend to help them out.
"Surgery ," one replied.
I was pretty alarmed by that response. It seems that the graduates of today are increasingly willing to go under the knife to get ahead of others when it comes to getting a job .
One girl told me that she was considering surgery to increase her height. "They break your legs, put in special extending screws, and slowly expand the gap between the two ends of the bone as it re-grows, you can get at least 5 cm taller!"
At that point, I was shocked. I am short, I can't deny that, but I don't think I would put myself through months of agony just to be a few centimetres taller. I don't even bother to wear shoes with thick soles, as I'm not trying to hide the fact that I am just not tall!
It seems to me that there is a trend towards wanting "perfection" , and that is an ideal that just does not exist in reality.
No one is born perfect, yet magazines, TV shows and movies present images of thin, tall, beautiful people as being the norm. Advertisements for slimming aids, beauty treatments and cosmetic surgery clinics fill the pages of newspapers, further creating an idea that "perfection" is a requirement, and that it must be purchased, no matter what the cost. In my opinion, skills, rather than appearance, should determine how successful a person is in his/her chosen career.

### REAL QUESTION — ANSWER THIS ONLY ###
Passage:
Starting a new school term is always exciting. It is a chance to see all of your friends again. But most exciting of all, the new term is an opportunity to take up new hobbies. As you know, it is common in Britain for students to take up new hobbies after the Christmas holidays. Promising to begin something new is a common New Year resolution for many school teenagers.
Most schools offer different kinds of hobby classes. Students take them in their free periods or after school. Some classes you have to pay for and others are free of charge. For example, I once took a free Wednesday evening gymnastics class that my school offered. But when I learnt how to play the drum my parents had to pay for the lesson, and they did so, like most parents, without any complaint.
The most popular extra classes at my school were piano lessons and drama club:  Both classes offered exams students could take. Because the extra classes may take up much time of the students, students with many hobbies sometimes felt more stressed than those without any. But they could enjoy their life better than those who didn't foster   any hobbies at school. For example, they could build up good friendship with the persons who shared the common interest with them. Most important of all, the students with hobbies left school with many extra skills.
Frankly speaking, I haven't continued any of the hobbies I began at school. But I have never regretted taking them. After all, my best friend today is someone whom I met in my gymnastics class. The reason why we are still keeping in close touch with each other is that we have much in common.

Question:
From the author's experience, we can learn that  _  .

Options:
A: free hobby classes are very popular
B: hobbies are a way of making friends
C: we must be careful when choosing a hobby
D: hobby classes may not last a long time

Passage:
Last week I talked with some of my students about what they wanted to do after they graduated, and what kind of job prospects  they thought they had.
Given that I teach students who are training to be doctors, I was surprised do find that most thought that they would not be able to get the jobs they wanted without "outside help". "What kind of help is that?" I asked, expecting them to tell me that they would need a   or family friend to help them out.
"Surgery ," one replied.
I was pretty alarmed by that response. It seems that the graduates of today are increasingly willing to go under the knife to get ahead of others when it comes to getting a job .
One girl told me that she was considering surgery to increase her height. "They break your legs, put in special extending screws, and slowly expand the gap between the two ends of the bone as it re-grows, you can get at least 5 cm taller!"
At that point, I was shocked. I am short, I can't deny that, but I don't think I would put myself through months of agony just to be a few centimetres taller. I don't even bother to wear shoes with thick soles, as I'm not trying to hide the fact that I am just not tall!

It is a chance to see all of your friends again. But most exciting of all, the new term is an opportunity to take up new hobbies. As you know, it is common in Britain for students to take up new hobbies after the Christmas holidays. Promising to begin something new is a common New Year resolution for many school teenagers.\nMost schools offer different kinds of hobby classes. Students take them in their free periods or after school. Some classes you have to pay for and others are free of charge. For example, I once took a free Wednesday evening gymnastics class that my school offered. But when I learnt how to play the drum my parents had to pay for the lesson, and they did so, like most parents, without any complaint.\nThe most popular extra classes at my school were piano lessons and drama club:  Both classes offered exams students could take. Because the extra classes may take up much time of the students, students with many hobbies sometimes felt more stressed than those without any. But they could enjoy their life better than those who didn't foster   any hobbies at school. For example, they could build up good friendship with the persons who shared the common interest with them. Most important of all, the students with hobbies left school with many extra skills.\nFrankly speaking, I haven't continued any of the hobbies I began at school. But I have never regretted taking them. After all, my best friend today is someone whom I met in my gymnastics class. The reason why we are still keeping in close touch with each other is that we have much in common.\n\nQuestion:\nWhat is the purpose of the passage?\n\nOptions:\nA: To introduce some hobby classes at school.\nB: To tell readers how to choose hobby classes.\nC: To encourage readers to take up new hobbies.\nD: To report a trend among British school children.\n\n\nYour Answer:", "role": "user", "name": null, "raw": false}], "model": "rwkv", "stream": false, "stop": ["\n\nUser", "\n\nQuestion", "\n\nQ", "\n\nHuman", "\n\nBob", "\n\nAssistant", "\n\nAnswer", "\n\nA", "\n\nBot", "\n\nAlice", "\n\nObservation", "\n\nUser", "\n\nAss"], "tools": null, "tool_choice": "auto", "user_name": null, "assistant_name": null, "system_name": null, "presystem": false}

### FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES (DO NOT ANSWER) ###

--- EXAMPLE 1 (DO NOT ANSWER) START ---
Passage:
Last week I talked with some of my students about what they wanted to do after they graduated, and what kind of job prospects  they thought they had.
Given that I teach students who are training to be doctors, I was surprised do find that most thought that they would not be able to get the jobs they wanted without "outside help". "What kind of help is that?" I asked, expecting them to tell me that they would need a   or family friend to help them out.
"Surgery ," one replied.
I was pretty alarmed by that response. It seems that the graduates of today are increasingly willing to go under the knife to get ahead of others when it comes to getting a job .
One girl told me that she was considering surgery to increase her height. "They break your legs, put in special extending screws, and slowly expand the gap between the two ends of the bone as it re-grows, you can get at least 5 cm taller!"
At that point, I was shocked. I am short, I can't deny that, but I don't think I would put myself through months of agony just to be a few centimetres taller. I don't even bother to wear shoes with thick soles, as I'm not trying to hide the fact that I am just not tall!

I was afraid I just couldn't hide my excitement as it had been five years since I had been to the zoo. I was especially excited about getting to see the penguin exhibit that was completed since my last visit. I thought it would be just as magical as it was the last time.\nThe Tulsa Zoo is located on Mohawk Park, and covers 84 acres, making it the third largest zoo in the US. The zoo has several highlights, but I have to admit that I found myself rather disappointed. The maintenance is deeply lacking, and most of the exhibits, landscaping, etc. looked like it had not been updated or well kept. Unfortunately, their polar bear died a short time ago. The strangest attraction was the missing-in-action jaguar  . We spent several minutes searching for the animal without any luck. In most cases the zoo was good about putting up a sign if the animal was no longer there or was moved to a different location, but it was a different case with the jaguar and likewise the kangaroo.\nAlmost all of the hands-on equipment in the elephant encounter was broken and no longer working. Although the zoo did put up signs as an apology, it continued to add to the feeling that the zoo is approaching death. The one exhibit that did not fail to impress was the African Penguins. Their habitat was well built. The lion, bear, and tiger were also easy to watch. A favorite among the kids was clearly the monkeys who were very active and eager to put on a show.\nThe Tropical Rainforest did a very good job creating a special atmosphere. The cafe served very good food and had lovely indoor and outdoor areas for eating. They are currently re-designing the Sea Lion exhibit, so the Sea Lions were not available for viewing while we were there. All things considered, the Tulsa Zoo is still the best zoo in our area, but I would only award it three out of five stars.\n\nQuestion:\nSeeing several highlights in the Tulsa Zoo, the author   _  .\n\nOptions:\nA: felt very excited\nB: was a little frightened\nC: was not satisfied with them\nD: thought it was worth seeing\n\n\nYour Answer:", "role": "user", "name": null, "raw": false}], "model": "rwkv", "stream": false, "stop": ["\n\nUser", "\n\nQuestion", "\n\nQ", "\n\nHuman", "\n\nBob", "\n\nAssistant", "\n\nAnswer", "\n\nA", "\n\nBot", "\n\nAlice", "\n\nObservation", "\n\nUser", "\n\nAss"], "tools": null, "tool_choice": "auto", "user_name": null, "assistant_name": null, "system_name": null, "presystem": false}

### FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES (DO NOT ANSWER) ###

--- EXAMPLE 1 (DO NOT ANSWER) START ---
Passage:
Last week I talked with some of my students about what they wanted to do after they graduated, and what kind of job prospects  they thought they had.
Given that I teach students who are training to be doctors, I was surprised do find that most thought that they would not be able to get the jobs they wanted without "outside help". "What kind of help is that?" I asked, expecting them to tell me that they would need a   or family friend to help them out.
"Surgery ," one replied.
I was pretty alarmed by that response. It seems that the graduates of today are increasingly willing to go under the knife to get ahead of others when it comes to getting a job .
One girl told me that she was considering surgery to increase her height. "They break your legs, put in special extending screws, and slowly expand the gap between the two ends of the bone as it re-grows, you can get at least 5 cm taller!"
At that point, I was shocked. I am short, I can't deny that, but I don't think I would put myself through months of agony just to be a few centimetres taller. I don't even bother to wear shoes with thick soles, as I'm not trying to hide the fact that I am just not tall!
It seems to me that there is a trend towards wanting "perfection" , and that is an ideal that just does not exist in reality.

Advertisements for slimming aids, beauty treatments and cosmetic surgery clinics fill the pages of newspapers, further creating an idea that "perfection" is a requirement, and that it must be purchased, no matter what the cost. In my opinion, skills, rather than appearance, should determine how successful a person is in his/her chosen career.

Passage:

I was especially excited about getting to see the penguin exhibit that was completed since my last visit. I thought it would be just as magical as it was the last time.

They are currently re-designing the Sea Lion exhibit, so the Sea Lions were not available for viewing while we were there. All things considered, the Tulsa Zoo is still the best zoo in our area, but I would only award it three out of five stars.

Question:
Why did the author think it was a different case with the jaguar?

Options:
A: Because the jaguar was friendly to the kangaroo and visitors.
B: Because the zoo didn't use a sign to show if the jaguar was there.
C: Because the jaguar is very dangerous compared with other animals.
D: Because the jaguar had disappeared when the author got there.

I was afraid I just couldn't hide my excitement as it had been five years since I had been to the zoo. I was especially excited about getting to see the penguin exhibit that was completed since my last visit. I thought it would be just as magical as it was the last time.\nThe Tulsa Zoo is located on Mohawk Park, and covers 84 acres, making it the third largest zoo in the US. The zoo has several highlights, but I have to admit that I found myself rather disappointed. The maintenance is deeply lacking, and most of the exhibits, landscaping, etc. looked like it had not been updated or well kept. Unfortunately, their polar bear died a short time ago. The strangest attraction was the missing-in-action jaguar  . We spent several minutes searching for the animal without any luck. In most cases the zoo was good about putting up a sign if the animal was no longer there or was moved to a different location, but it was a different case with the jaguar and likewise the kangaroo.\nAlmost all of the hands-on equipment in the elephant encounter was broken and no longer working. Although the zoo did put up signs as an apology, it continued to add to the feeling that the zoo is approaching death. The one exhibit that did not fail to impress was the African Penguins. Their habitat was well built. The lion, bear, and tiger were also easy to watch. A favorite among the kids was clearly the monkeys who were very active and eager to put on a show.\nThe Tropical Rainforest did a very good job creating a special atmosphere. The cafe served very good food and had lovely indoor and outdoor areas for eating. They are currently re-designing the Sea Lion exhibit, so the Sea Lions were not available for viewing while we were there. All things considered, the Tulsa Zoo is still the best zoo in our area, but I would only award it three out of five stars.\n\nQuestion:\nWhy did the author think it was a different case with the jaguar?\n\nOptions:\nA: Because the jaguar was friendly to the kangaroo and visitors.\nB: Because the zoo didn't use a sign to show if the jaguar was there.\nC: Because the jaguar is very dangerous compared with other animals.\nD: Because the jaguar had disappeared when the author got there.\n\n\nYour Answer:", "role": "user", "name": null, "raw": false}], "model": "rwkv", "stream": false, "stop": ["\n\nUser", "\n\nQuestion", "\n\nQ", "\n\nHuman", "\n\nBob", "\n\nAssistant", "\n\nAnswer", "\n\nA", "\n\nBot", "\n\nAlice", "\n\nObservation", "\n\nUser", "\n\nAss"], "tools": null, "tool_choice": "auto", "user_name": null, "assistant_name": null, "system_name": null, "presystem": false}

### FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES (DO NOT ANSWER) ###

--- EXAMPLE 1 (DO NOT ANSWER) START ---
Passage:
Last week I talked with some of my students about what they wanted to do after they graduated, and what kind of job prospects  they thought they had.
Given that I teach students who are training to be doctors, I was surprised do find that most thought that they would not be able to get the jobs they wanted without "outside help". "What kind of help is that?" I asked, expecting them to tell me that they would need a   or family friend to help them out.
"Surgery ," one replied.
I was pretty alarmed by that response. It seems that the graduates of today are increasingly willing to go under the knife to get ahead of others when it comes to getting a job .
One girl told me that she was considering surgery to increase her height. "They break your legs, put in special extending screws, and slowly expand the gap between the two ends of the bone as it re-grows, you can get at least 5 cm taller!"
At that point, I was shocked. I am short, I can't deny that, but I don't think I would put myself through months of agony just to be a few centimetres taller. I don't even bother to wear shoes with thick soles, as I'm not trying to hide the fact that I am just not tall!
It seems to me that there is a trend towards wanting "perfection" , and that is an ideal that just does not exist in reality.

Advertisements for slimming aids, beauty treatments and cosmetic surgery clinics fill the pages of newspapers, further creating an idea that "perfection" is a requirement, and that it must be purchased, no matter what the cost. In my opinion, skills, rather than appearance, should determine how successful a person is in his/her chosen career.

The maintenance is deeply lacking, and most of the exhibits, landscaping, etc. looked like it had not been updated or well kept. Unfortunately, their polar bear died a short time ago. The strangest attraction was the missing-in-action jaguar  . We spent several minutes searching for the animal without any luck. In most cases the zoo was good about putting up a sign if the animal was no longer there or was moved to a different location, but it was a different case with the jaguar and likewise the kangaroo.\nAlmost all of the hands-on equipment in the elephant encounter was broken and no longer working. Although the zoo did put up signs as an apology, it continued to add to the feeling that the zoo is approaching death. The one exhibit that did not fail to impress was the African Penguins. Their habitat was well built. The lion, bear, and tiger were also easy to watch. A favorite among the kids was clearly the monkeys who were very active and eager to put on a show.\nThe Tropical Rainforest did a very good job creating a special atmosphere. The cafe served very good food and had lovely indoor and outdoor areas for eating. They are currently re-designing the Sea Lion exhibit, so the Sea Lions were not available for viewing while we were there. All things considered, the Tulsa Zoo is still the best zoo in our area, but I would only award it three out of five stars.\n\nQuestion:\nWhat does the author think of the Tulsa Zoo in general?\n\nOptions:\nA: It is a first class zoo in her area.\nB: It is the best zoo in the US.\nC: She thinks very poorly of it.\nD: She thinks nothing of it.\n\n\nYour Answer:", "role": "user", "name": null, "raw": false}], "model": "rwkv", "stream": false, "stop": ["\n\nUser", "\n\nQuestion", "\n\nQ", "\n\nHuman", "\n\nBob", "\n\nAssistant", "\n\nAnswer", "\n\nA", "\n\nBot", "\n\nAlice", "\n\nObservation", "\n\nUser", "\n\nAss"], "tools": null, "tool_choice": "auto", "user_name": null, "assistant_name": null, "system_name": null, "presystem": false}

### FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES (DO NOT ANSWER) ###

--- EXAMPLE 1 (DO NOT ANSWER) START ---
Passage:
Last week I talked with some of my students about what they wanted to do after they graduated, and what kind of job prospects  they thought they had.
Given that I teach students who are training to be doctors, I was surprised do find that most thought that they would not be able to get the jobs they wanted without "outside help". "What kind of help is that?" I asked, expecting them to tell me that they would need a   or family friend to help them out.
"Surgery ," one replied.
I was pretty alarmed by that response. It seems that the graduates of today are increasingly willing to go under the knife to get ahead of others when it comes to getting a job .
One girl told me that she was considering surgery to increase her height. "They break your legs, put in special extending screws, and slowly expand the gap between the two ends of the bone as it re-grows, you can get at least 5 cm taller!"
At that point, I was shocked. I am short, I can't deny that, but I don't think I would put myself through months of agony just to be a few centimetres taller. I don't even bother to wear shoes with thick soles, as I'm not trying to hide the fact that I am just not tall!
It seems to me that there is a trend towards wanting "perfection" , and that is an ideal that just does not exist in reality.

In my opinion, skills, rather than appearance, should determine how successful a person is in his/her chosen career.

### FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES (DO NOT ANSWER) ###

--- EXAMPLE 1 (DO NOT ANSWER) START ---
Passage:
Last week I talked with some of my students about what they wanted to do after they graduated, and what kind of job prospects  they thought they had.
Given that I teach students who are training to be doctors, I was surprised do find that most thought that they would not be able to get the jobs they wanted without "outside help". "What kind of help is that?" I asked, expecting them to tell me that they would need a   or family friend to help them out.
"Surgery ," one replied.
I was pretty alarmed by that response. It seems that the graduates of today are increasingly willing to go under the knife to get ahead of others when it comes to getting a job .
One girl told me that she was considering surgery to increase her height. "They break your legs, put in special extending screws, and slowly expand the gap between the two ends of the bone as it re-grows, you can get at least 5 cm taller!"
At that point, I was shocked. I am short, I can't deny that, but I don't think I would put myself through months of agony just to be a few centimetres taller. I don't even bother to wear shoes with thick soles, as I'm not trying to hide the fact that I am just not tall!
It seems to me that there is a trend towards wanting "perfection" , and that is an ideal that just does not exist in reality.

In my opinion, skills, rather than appearance, should determine how successful a person is in his/her chosen career.

### FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES (DO NOT ANSWER) ###

--- EXAMPLE 1 (DO NOT ANSWER) START ---
Passage:
Last week I talked with some of my students about what they wanted to do after they graduated, and what kind of job prospects  they thought they had.
Given that I teach students who are training to be doctors, I was surprised do find that most thought that they would not be able to get the jobs they wanted without "outside help". "What kind of help is that?" I asked, expecting them to tell me that they would need a   or family friend to help them out.
"Surgery ," one replied.
I was pretty alarmed by that response. It seems that the graduates of today are increasingly willing to go under the knife to get ahead of others when it comes to getting a job .
One girl told me that she was considering surgery to increase her height. "They break your legs, put in special extending screws, and slowly expand the gap between the two ends of the bone as it re-grows, you can get at least 5 cm taller!"
At that point, I was shocked. I am short, I can't deny that, but I don't think I would put myself through months of agony just to be a few centimetres taller. I don't even bother to wear shoes with thick soles, as I'm not trying to hide the fact that I am just not tall!
It seems to me that there is a trend towards wanting "perfection" , and that is an ideal that just does not exist in reality.

In my opinion, skills, rather than appearance, should determine how successful a person is in his/her chosen career.

--- EXAMPLE 1 (DO NOT ANSWER) START ---
Passage:
Last week I talked with some of my students about what they wanted to do after they graduated, and what kind of job prospects  they thought they had.
Given that I teach students who are training to be doctors, I was surprised do find that most thought that they would not be able to get the jobs they wanted without "outside help". "What kind of help is that?" I asked, expecting them to tell me that they would need a   or family friend to help them out.
"Surgery ," one replied.
I was pretty alarmed by that response. It seems that the graduates of today are increasingly willing to go under the knife to get ahead of others when it comes to getting a job .
One girl told me that she was considering surgery to increase her height. "They break your legs, put in special extending screws, and slowly expand the gap between the two ends of the bone as it re-grows, you can get at least 5 cm taller!"
At that point, I was shocked. I am short, I can't deny that, but I don't think I would put myself through months of agony just to be a few centimetres taller. I don't even bother to wear shoes with thick soles, as I'm not trying to hide the fact that I am just not tall!
It seems to me that there is a trend towards wanting "perfection" , and that is an ideal that just does not exist in reality.
No one is born perfect, yet magazines, TV shows and movies present images of thin, tall, beautiful people as being the norm. Advertisements for slimming aids, beauty treatments and cosmetic surgery clinics fill the pages of newspapers, further creating an idea that "perfection" is a requirement, and that it must be purchased, no matter what the cost. In my opinion, skills, rather than appearance, should determine how successful a person is in his/her chosen career.

### REAL QUESTION — ANSWER THIS ONLY ###
Passage:
LONDON: What could possibly be wrong with planting trees? The advantages are obvious; they  firm the soil, soak up   extra water and take carbon dioxide   out of the atmosphere.
However, it now turns out that planting trees could add to global warming.
Tree roots do a great job of keeping soil firmly on the ground and out of the wind's power. The problem is that some of those dust clouds play an important part in soaking up carbon dioxide.
Huge dust storms blow out over the oceans from dry parts of North Africa and central Asia. Tons of dust are lifted and left as a thin film over the ocean surface. The dust fuels oceanic life.
Dust from China is carried east and left in the Pacific Ocean. If a tree-planting programme there is successful and the dust supply reduced, the net result may be that less carbon dioxide gets locked away in the ocean.
Andy Ridgwell, an environmental scientist from the University of East Anglia, has spent the past few years studying dust and says his work "shows clearly the complexity of the system and the importance of not tinkering  with it without understanding the results. For this reason there is the need to focus  on cutting carbon dioxide giving off rather than monkeying   about with the land surface."
An American scientist, Robert Jackson, has shown that when native grassland areas are invaded  by trees, carbon is lost from the soil. "We are studying why the soil carbon disappears, but one theory is that trees do a lot more of their growing above ground compared to grasses, so less carbon goes directly into the soil from trees, " says Jackson.
In wet areas of the world, the gain from trees absorbing carbon dioxide above ground seems to be outweighed  by the loss of carbon from the soil below ground. Countries that plan to _ global warming by planting trees may have to think again. Solutions  to environmental problems are often more complex than they first appear, and understanding the Earth's climate is a very great challenge.

Question:
People usually hold the opinion that

Options:
A: huge dust storms can destroy carbon dioxide
B: huge dust storms can destroy the oceans on the earth
C: huge dust storms can't do anything beneficial for man
D: planting trees is the only way to control huge dust storms

### FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES (DO NOT ANSWER) ###

--- EXAMPLE 1 (DO NOT ANSWER) START ---
Passage:
Last week I talked with some of my students about what they wanted to do after they graduated, and what kind of job prospects  they thought they had.
Given that I teach students who are training to be doctors, I was surprised do find that most thought that they would not be able to get the jobs they wanted without "outside help". "What kind of help is that?" I asked, expecting them to tell me that they would need a   or family friend to help them out.
"Surgery ," one replied.
I was pretty alarmed by that response. It seems that the graduates of today are increasingly willing to go under the knife to get ahead of others when it comes to getting a job .
One girl told me that she was considering surgery to increase her height. "They break your legs, put in special extending screws, and slowly expand the gap between the two ends of the bone as it re-grows, you can get at least 5 cm taller!"
At that point, I was shocked. I am short, I can't deny that, but I don't think I would put myself through months of agony just to be a few centimetres taller. I don't even bother to wear shoes with thick soles, as I'm not trying to hide the fact that I am just not tall!
It seems to me that there is a trend towards wanting "perfection" , and that is an ideal that just does not exist in reality.
No one is born perfect, yet magazines, TV shows and movies present images of thin, tall, beautiful people as being the norm. Advertisements for slimming aids, beauty treatments and cosmetic surgery clinics fill the pages of newspapers, further creating an idea that "perfection" is a requirement, and that it must be purchased, no matter what the cost. In my opinion, skills, rather than appearance, should determine how successful a person is in his/her chosen career.

### REAL QUESTION — ANSWER THIS ONLY ###
Passage:
LONDON: What could possibly be wrong with planting trees? The advantages are obvious; they  firm the soil, soak up   extra water and take carbon dioxide   out of the atmosphere.
However, it now turns out that planting trees could add to global warming.
Tree roots do a great job of keeping soil firmly on the ground and out of the wind's power. The problem is that some of those dust clouds play an important part in soaking up carbon dioxide.
Huge dust storms blow out over the oceans from dry parts of North Africa and central Asia. Tons of dust are lifted and left as a thin film over the ocean surface. The dust fuels oceanic life.
Dust from China is carried east and left in the Pacific Ocean. If a tree-planting programme there is successful and the dust supply reduced, the net result may be that less carbon dioxide gets locked away in the ocean.
Andy Ridgwell, an environmental scientist from the University of East Anglia, has spent the past few years studying dust and says his work "shows clearly the complexity of the system and the importance of not tinkering  with it without understanding the results. For this reason there is the need to focus  on cutting carbon dioxide giving off rather than monkeying   about with the land surface."
An American scientist, Robert Jackson, has shown that when native grassland areas are invaded  by trees, carbon is lost from the soil. "We are studying why the soil carbon disappears, but one theory is that trees do a lot more of their growing above ground compared to grasses, so less carbon goes directly into the soil from trees, " says Jackson.
In wet areas of the world, the gain from trees absorbing carbon dioxide above ground seems to be outweighed  by the loss of carbon from the soil below ground. Countries that plan to _ global warming by planting trees may have to think again. Solutions  to environmental problems are often more complex than they first appear, and understanding the Earth's climate is a very great challenge.

Question:
Andy Ridgwell, the environmental scientist, believes that

Options:
A: dust plays a more important part than trees
B: trees shouldn't have been planted in dry places
C: carbon dioxide is harmful to everything on the earth
D: environmental problems are more complex than expected

### FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES (DO NOT ANSWER) ###

--- EXAMPLE 1 (DO NOT ANSWER) START ---
Passage:
Last week I talked with some of my students about what they wanted to do after they graduated, and what kind of job prospects  they thought they had.
Given that I teach students who are training to be doctors, I was surprised do find that most thought that they would not be able to get the jobs they wanted without "outside help". "What kind of help is that?" I asked, expecting them to tell me that they would need a   or family friend to help them out.
"Surgery ," one replied.
I was pretty alarmed by that response. It seems that the graduates of today are increasingly willing to go under the knife to get ahead of others when it comes to getting a job .
One girl told me that she was considering surgery to increase her height. "They break your legs, put in special extending screws, and slowly expand the gap between the two ends of the bone as it re-grows, you can get at least 5 cm taller!"
At that point, I was shocked. I am short, I can't deny that, but I don't think I would put myself through months of agony just to be a few centimetres taller. I don't even bother to wear shoes with thick soles, as I'm not trying to hide the fact that I am just not tall!
It seems to me that there is a trend towards wanting "perfection" , and that is an ideal that just does not exist in reality.
No one is born perfect, yet magazines, TV shows and movies present images of thin, tall, beautiful people as being the norm. Advertisements for slimming aids, beauty treatments and cosmetic surgery clinics fill the pages of newspapers, further creating an idea that "perfection" is a requirement, and that it must be purchased, no matter what the cost. In my opinion, skills, rather than appearance, should determine how successful a person is in his/her chosen career.

### REAL QUESTION — ANSWER THIS ONLY ###
Passage:
LONDON: What could possibly be wrong with planting trees? The advantages are obvious; they  firm the soil, soak up   extra water and take carbon dioxide   out of the atmosphere.
However, it now turns out that planting trees could add to global warming.
Tree roots do a great job of keeping soil firmly on the ground and out of the wind's power. The problem is that some of those dust clouds play an important part in soaking up carbon dioxide.
Huge dust storms blow out over the oceans from dry parts of North Africa and central Asia. Tons of dust are lifted and left as a thin film over the ocean surface. The dust fuels oceanic life.
Dust from China is carried east and left in the Pacific Ocean. If a tree-planting programme there is successful and the dust supply reduced, the net result may be that less carbon dioxide gets locked away in the ocean.
Andy Ridgwell, an environmental scientist from the University of East Anglia, has spent the past few years studying dust and says his work "shows clearly the complexity of the system and the importance of not tinkering  with it without understanding the results. For this reason there is the need to focus  on cutting carbon dioxide giving off rather than monkeying   about with the land surface."
An American scientist, Robert Jackson, has shown that when native grassland areas are invaded  by trees, carbon is lost from the soil. "We are studying why the soil carbon disappears, but one theory is that trees do a lot more of their growing above ground compared to grasses, so less carbon goes directly into the soil from trees, " says Jackson.
In wet areas of the world, the gain from trees absorbing carbon dioxide above ground seems to be outweighed  by the loss of carbon from the soil below ground. Countries that plan to _ global warming by planting trees may have to think again. Solutions  to environmental problems are often more complex than they first appear, and understanding the Earth's climate is a very great challenge.

Question:
Robert Jackson's experiment proves that

Options:
A: grassland areas should be covered by forests
B: trees hold more carbon than grass
C: carbon can turn grass into dust
D: less carbon can make trees grow faster

They spent two days beginning the task of formulating   ideas about how to design such structures and to search for clues on how to do so in buildings that were damaged, but still are standing.\\n       \\"Our objective in visiting ground zero was to go and look at the buildings surrounding the World Trade Center, those buildings that are still standing, but that sustained damage,\\" said M. Bruneau, Ph.D. \\"Our immediate hope is that we can develop a better understanding as to why those buildings remain standing, while our long-term goal is to see whether earthquake engineering technologies can be married to existing technologies to achieve enhanced performance of buildings in the event of terrorist attacks,\\" he added.\\n       Photographs taken by the investigators demonstrate the monumental damage to the World Trade Center towers and buildings nearby. One building a block away from the towers remains standing, but was badly damaged. \\"This building is many meters away from the World Trade Center and yet we see a column   there that used to be part of that building,\\" explained A. Whittaker, Ph.D. \\"The column became a missile that shot across the road, through the window and through the floor.\\"\\n       The visit to the area also brought some surprises, according to the engineers. For example, the floor framing   system in one of the buildings was quite strong , allowing floors that were pierced by tons of falling debris   to survive. \\"Good framing systems may provide a simple, but reliable strategy for blast resistance,\\" he added. Other strategies may include providing alternate paths for gravity loads in the event that a load-bearing column fails. \\"We also need a better understanding of the mechanism of collapse,\\" said A. Whittaker. \\"We need to find out what causes a building to collapse and how you can predict it.\\"\\n       A. Reinhorn, Ph.D. noted that \\"earthquake shaking has led to the collapse of buildings in the past. Solutions developed for earthquake-resistant design may apply to blast engineering and terrorist-resistant design. Part of our mission now is to transfer these solutions and to develop new ones where none exist at present.\\"\\n\\nQuestion:\\nThe column mentioned by Dr. Whittaker   _   .\\n\\nOptions:\\nA: was part of the building close to the World Trade Center\\nB: was part of the World Trade Center\\nC: was shot through the window and the floor of the World Trade Center\\nD: damaged many buildings near the World Trade Center\\n\\n\\nYour Answer:", "raw": false}], "stream": false, "max_tokens": 5, "temperature": 0.0}'

Passage:
Last week I talked with some of my students about what they wanted to do after they graduated, and what kind of job prospects  they thought they had.
Given that I teach students who are training to be doctors, I was surprised do find that most thought that they would not be able to get the jobs they wanted without "outside help". "What kind of help is that?" I asked, expecting them to tell me that they would need a   or family friend to help them out.
"Surgery ," one replied.
I was pretty alarmed by that response. It seems that the graduates of today are increasingly willing to go under the knife to get ahead of others when it comes to getting a job .
One girl told me that she was considering surgery to increase her height. "They break your legs, put in special extending screws, and slowly expand the gap between the two ends of the bone as it re-grows, you can get at least 5 cm taller!"
At that point, I was shocked. I am short, I can't deny that, but I don't think I would put myself through months of agony just to be a few centimetres taller. I don't even bother to wear shoes with thick soles, as I'm not trying to hide the fact that I am just not tall!
It seems to me that there is a trend towards wanting "perfection" , and that is an ideal that just does not exist in reality.

"Surgery ," one replied.
I was pretty alarmed by that response. It seems that the graduates of today are increasingly willing to go under the knife to get ahead of others when it comes to getting a job .
One girl told me that she was considering surgery to increase her height. "They break your legs, put in special extending screws, and slowly expand the gap between the two ends of the bone as it re-grows, you can get at least 5 cm taller!"
At that point, I was shocked. I am short, I can't deny that, but I don't think I would put myself through months of agony just to be a few centimetres taller. I don't even bother to wear shoes with thick soles, as I'm not trying to hide the fact that I am just not tall!
It seems to me that there is a trend towards wanting "perfection" , and that is an ideal that just does not exist in reality.
No one is born perfect, yet magazines, TV shows and movies present images of thin, tall, beautiful people as being the norm. Advertisements for slimming aids, beauty treatments and cosmetic surgery clinics fill the pages of newspapers, further creating an idea that "perfection" is a requirement, and that it must be purchased, no matter what the cost. In my opinion, skills, rather than appearance, should determine how successful a person is in his/her chosen career.

Question:
Many graduates today turn to cosmetic surgery to_.

Options:
A: marry a better man/woman
B: become a model
C: get an advantage over others in job-hunting
D: attract more admirers

Correct Answer: C

Passage:
Last week I talked with some of my students about what they wanted to do after they graduated, and what kind of job prospects  they thought they had.

Question:
According to the passage, the author believes that_.

Options:
A: everyone should purchase perfection, whatever the cost
B: it's right for graduates to ask for others to help them out in hunting for jobs
C: it is one's appearance instead of skills that really matters in one's career
D: media are to blame for misleading young people in their seeking for surgery

### REAL QUESTION — ANSWER THIS ONLY ###
Passage:
During the years after the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center, structural engineers have been trying hard to solve a question that would otherwise have been completely unthinkable: Can building be designed to stand catastrophic blasts   by terrorists?
       Soon after the terrorist attacks on the twin towers, structural engineers from the University at Buffalo and the Multidisciplinary Center for Earthquake Engineering Research (MCEER) traveled to ground zero as part of a project funded by the National Science Foundation. They spent two days beginning the task of formulating   ideas about how to design such structures and to search for clues on how to do so in buildings that were damaged, but still are standing.
       "Our objective in visiting ground zero was to go and look at the buildings surrounding the World Trade Center, those buildings that are still standing, but that sustained damage," said M. Bruneau, Ph.D. "Our immediate hope is that we can develop a better understanding as to why those buildings remain standing, while our long-term goal is to see whether earthquake engineering technologies can be married to existing technologies to achieve enhanced performance of buildings in the event of terrorist attacks," he added.
       Photographs taken by the investigators demonstrate the monumental damage to the World Trade Center towers and buildings nearby. One building a block away from the towers remains standing, but was badly damaged. "This building is many meters away from the World Trade Center and yet we see a column   there that used to be part of that building," explained A. Whittaker, Ph.D. "The column became a missile that shot across the road, through the window and through the floor."
       The visit to the area also brought some surprises, according to the engineers. For example, the floor framing   system in one of the buildings was quite strong , allowing floors that were pierced by tons of falling debris   to survive. "Good framing systems may provide a simple, but reliable strategy for blast resistance," he added. Other strategies may include providing alternate paths for gravity loads in the event that a load-bearing column fails. "We also need a better understanding of the mechanism of collapse," said A. Whittaker. "We need to find out what causes a building to collapse and how you can predict it."
       A. Reinhorn, Ph.D. noted that "earthquake shaking has led to the collapse of buildings in the past. Solutions developed for earthquake-resistant design may apply to blast engineering and terrorist-resistant design. Part of our mission now is to transfer these solutions and to develop new ones where none exist at present."

Question:
The column mentioned by Dr. Whittaker   _   .

Options:
A: was part of the building close to the World Trade Center
B: was part of the World Trade Center
C: was shot through the window and the floor of the World Trade Center
D: damaged many buildings near the World Trade Center

### FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES (DO NOT ANSWER) ###

--- EXAMPLE 1 (DO NOT ANSWER) START ---
Passage:
Last week I talked with some of my students about what they wanted to do after they graduated, and what kind of job prospects  they thought they had.
Given that I teach students who are training to be doctors, I was surprised do find that most thought that they would not be able to get the jobs they wanted without "outside help". "What kind of help is that?" I asked, expecting them to tell me that they would need a   or family friend to help them out.
"Surgery ," one replied.
I was pretty alarmed by that response. It seems that the graduates of today are increasingly willing to go under the knife to get ahead of others when it comes to getting a job .
One girl told me that she was considering surgery to increase her height. "They break your legs, put in special extending screws, and slowly expand the gap between the two ends of the bone as it re-grows, you can get at least 5 cm taller!"
At that point, I was shocked. I am short, I can't deny that, but I don't think I would put myself through months of agony just to be a few centimetres taller. I don't even bother to wear shoes with thick soles, as I'm not trying to hide the fact that I am just not tall!
It seems to me that there is a trend towards wanting "perfection" , and that is an ideal that just does not exist in reality.
No one is born perfect, yet magazines, TV shows and movies present images of thin, tall, beautiful people as being the norm. Advertisements for slimming aids, beauty treatments and cosmetic surgery clinics fill the pages of newspapers, further creating an idea that "perfection" is a requirement, and that it must be purchased, no matter what the cost. In my opinion, skills, rather than appearance, should determine how successful a person is in his/her chosen career.

Passage:
Last week I talked with some of my students about what they wanted to do after they graduated, and what kind of job prospects  they thought they had.
Given that I teach students who are training to be doctors, I was surprised do find that most thought that they would not be able to get the jobs they wanted without "outside help". "What kind of help is that?" I asked, expecting them to tell me that they would need a   or family friend to help them out.
"Surgery ," one replied.
I was pretty alarmed by that response. It seems that the graduates of today are increasingly willing to go under the knife to get ahead of others when it comes to getting a job .
One girl told me that she was considering surgery to increase her height. "They break your legs, put in special extending screws, and slowly expand the gap between the two ends of the bone as it re-grows, you can get at least 5 cm taller!"
At that point, I was shocked. I am short, I can't deny that, but I don't think I would put myself through months of agony just to be a few centimetres taller. I don't even bother to wear shoes with thick soles, as I'm not trying to hide the fact that I am just not tall!
It seems to me that there is a trend towards wanting "perfection" , and that is an ideal that just does not exist in reality.
No one is born perfect, yet magazines, TV shows and movies present images of thin, tall, beautiful people as being the norm. Advertisements for slimming aids, beauty treatments and cosmetic surgery clinics fill the pages of newspapers, further creating an idea that "perfection" is a requirement, and that it must be purchased, no matter what the cost. In my opinion, skills, rather than appearance, should determine how successful a person is in his/her chosen career.

Question:
According to the passage, the author believes that_.

Options:
A: everyone should purchase perfection, whatever the cost
B: it's right for graduates to ask for others to help them out in hunting for jobs
C: it is one's appearance instead of skills that really matters in one's career
D: media are to blame for misleading young people in their seeking for surgery

Correct Answer: D

### REAL QUESTION — ANSWER THIS ONLY ###
Passage:
During the years after the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center, structural engineers have been trying hard to solve a question that would otherwise have been completely unthinkable: Can building be designed to stand catastrophic blasts   by terrorists?
       Soon after the terrorist attacks on the twin towers, structural engineers from the University at Buffalo and the Multidisciplinary Center for Earthquake Engineering Research (MCEER) traveled to ground zero as part of a project funded by the National Science Foundation. They spent two days beginning the task of formulating   ideas about how to design such structures and to search for clues on how to do so in buildings that were damaged, but still are standing.
       "Our objective in visiting ground zero was to go and look at the buildings surrounding the World Trade Center, those buildings that are still standing, but that sustained damage," said M. Bruneau, Ph.D. "Our immediate hope is that we can develop a better understanding as to why those buildings remain standing, while our long-term goal is to see whether earthquake engineering technologies can be married to existing technologies to achieve enhanced performance of buildings in the event of terrorist attacks," he added.
       Photographs taken by the investigators demonstrate the monumental damage to the World Trade Center towers and buildings nearby. One building a block away from the towers remains standing, but was badly damaged. "This building is many meters away from the World Trade Center and yet we see a column   there that used to be part of that building," explained A. Whittaker, Ph.D. "The column became a missile that shot across the road, through the window and through the floor."
       The visit to the area also brought some surprises, according to the engineers. For example, the floor framing   system in one of the buildings was quite strong , allowing floors that were pierced by tons of falling debris   to survive. "Good framing systems may provide a simple, but reliable strategy for blast resistance," he added. Other strategies may include providing alternate paths for gravity loads in the event that a load-bearing column fails. "We also need a better understanding of the mechanism of collapse," said A. Whittaker. "We need to find out what causes a building to collapse and how you can predict it."
       A. Reinhorn, Ph.D. noted that "earthquake shaking has led to the collapse of buildings in the past. Solutions developed for earthquake-resistant design may apply to blast engineering and terrorist-resistant design. Part of our mission now is to transfer these solutions and to develop new ones where none exist at present."

Question:
A surprising discovery made by the investigators during their visit to ground zero is that   _  .

Options:
A: floors in the faraway buildings remained undamaged
B: some floor framing systems demonstrate resistance to explosion
C: complex floor framing systems are more blast resistant
D: floors in one of the buildings were pierced by tons of debris

Passage:
The advertisement appeared in my e-mail--"1-800-Flowers: Mother's Day Madness --for just $39.99!" I almost clicked on it, forgetting that those services would not be needed this year. My mother, Margaret Feiddman, died at the age of 89, and so this is my first Mother's Day without my mom.
In my childhood, my mom appeared to be a typical suburban housewife of her generation. She sewed many of my sisters' clothes, including both of their wedding dresses and boy's suits for me. And on the side, she won several national bridge tournaments .
My mom left many indelible marks on me. The first was to never lose heart and to be independent. My dad died suddenly when I was 19. My mom worked hard for a couple of years. But in1975, I won a scholarship to study in Britain and my mom surprised us all by announcing that she decided to go with me. When I met difficulties, she always said: "You're a man, so never lose heart, never be knocked down, and try your best to pursue  your dreams."
My mom's other big influence on me is a sense of optimism. She had taken her knocks. But every time life knocked her down, she got up and kept on marching forward, encouraged by the saying that pessimists  are usually right, optimists are usually wrong, but most great changes are made by optimists.
How I wish to listen to my mother's words, and give my best regards on this Mother's Day, but I have no chance now! My best friends, treasure your mother's love!

Question:
The author mentioned the advertisement to   _  .

Options:
A: show he's tired of the advertisements
B: explain he missed his mother very much
C: make you believe that he was very kind
D: urge the readers to buy the present for their mothers

--- EXAMPLE 1 (DO NOT ANSWER) START ---
Passage:
Last week I talked with some of my students about what they wanted to do after they graduated, and what kind of job prospects  they thought they had.
Given that I teach students who are training to be doctors, I was surprised do find that most thought that they would not be able to get the jobs they wanted without "outside help". "What kind of help is that?" I asked, expecting them to tell me that they would need a   or family friend to help them out.
"Surgery ," one replied.
I was pretty alarmed by that response. It seems that the graduates of today are increasingly willing to go under the knife to get ahead of others when it comes to getting a job .
One girl told me that she was considering surgery to increase her height. "They break your legs, put in special extending screws, and slowly expand the gap between the two ends of the bone as it re-grows, you can get at least 5 cm taller!"
At that point, I was shocked. I am short, I can't deny that, but I don't think I would put myself through months of agony just to be a few centimetres taller. I don't even bother to wear shoes with thick soles, as I'm not trying to hide the fact that I am just not tall!

### REAL QUESTION — ANSWER THIS ONLY ###
Passage:
The advertisement appeared in my e-mail--"1-800-Flowers: Mother's Day Madness --for just $39.99!" I almost clicked on it, forgetting that those services would not be needed this year. My mother, Margaret Feiddman, died at the age of 89, and so this is my first Mother's Day without my mom.
In my childhood, my mom appeared to be a typical suburban housewife of her generation. She sewed many of my sisters' clothes, including both of their wedding dresses and boy's suits for me. And on the side, she won several national bridge tournaments .
My mom left many indelible marks on me. The first was to never lose heart and to be independent. My dad died suddenly when I was 19. My mom worked hard for a couple of years. But in1975, I won a scholarship to study in Britain and my mom surprised us all by announcing that she decided to go with me. When I met difficulties, she always said: "You're a man, so never lose heart, never be knocked down, and try your best to pursue  your dreams."
My mom's other big influence on me is a sense of optimism. She had taken her knocks. But every time life knocked her down, she got up and kept on marching forward, encouraged by the saying that pessimists  are usually right, optimists are usually wrong, but most great changes are made by optimists.
How I wish to listen to my mother's words, and give my best regards on this Mother's Day, but I have no chance now! My best friends, treasure your mother's love!

Question:
What experience of the author's mother surprised the author?

Options:
A: That she volunteered to go to Britain with her son.
B: That she gained knowledge all by herself.
C: That she did all the housework by herself.
D: That she won several national bridge tournaments.

### FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES (DO NOT ANSWER) ###

--- EXAMPLE 1 (DO NOT ANSWER) START ---
Passage:
Last week I talked with some of my students about what they wanted to do after they graduated, and what kind of job prospects  they thought they had.
Given that I teach students who are training to be doctors, I was surprised do find that most thought that they would not be able to get the jobs they wanted without "outside help". "What kind of help is that?" I asked, expecting them to tell me that they would need a   or family friend to help them out.
"Surgery ," one replied.
I was pretty alarmed by that response. It seems that the graduates of today are increasingly willing to go under the knife to get ahead of others when it comes to getting a job .
One girl told me that she was considering surgery to increase her height. "They break your legs, put in special extending screws, and slowly expand the gap between the two ends of the bone as it re-grows, you can get at least 5 cm taller!"
At that point, I was shocked. I am short, I can't deny that, but I don't think I would put myself through months of agony just to be a few centimetres taller. I don't even bother to wear shoes with thick soles, as I'm not trying to hide the fact that I am just not tall!
It seems to me that there is a trend towards wanting "perfection" , and that is an ideal that just does not exist in reality.

### REAL QUESTION — ANSWER THIS ONLY ###
Passage:
The advertisement appeared in my e-mail--"1-800-Flowers: Mother's Day Madness --for just $39.99!" I almost clicked on it, forgetting that those services would not be needed this year. My mother, Margaret Feiddman, died at the age of 89, and so this is my first Mother's Day without my mom.
In my childhood, my mom appeared to be a typical suburban housewife of her generation. She sewed many of my sisters' clothes, including both of their wedding dresses and boy's suits for me. And on the side, she won several national bridge tournaments .
My mom left many indelible marks on me. The first was to never lose heart and to be independent. My dad died suddenly when I was 19. My mom worked hard for a couple of years. But in1975, I won a scholarship to study in Britain and my mom surprised us all by announcing that she decided to go with me. When I met difficulties, she always said: "You're a man, so never lose heart, never be knocked down, and try your best to pursue  your dreams."
My mom's other big influence on me is a sense of optimism. She had taken her knocks. But every time life knocked her down, she got up and kept on marching forward, encouraged by the saying that pessimists  are usually right, optimists are usually wrong, but most great changes are made by optimists.
How I wish to listen to my mother's words, and give my best regards on this Mother's Day, but I have no chance now! My best friends, treasure your mother's love!

### FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES (DO NOT ANSWER) ###

--- EXAMPLE 1 (DO NOT ANSWER) START ---
Passage:
Last week I talked with some of my students about what they wanted to do after they graduated, and what kind of job prospects  they thought they had.
Given that I teach students who are training to be doctors, I was surprised do find that most thought that they would not be able to get the jobs they wanted without "outside help". "What kind of help is that?" I asked, expecting them to tell me that they would need a   or family friend to help them out.
"Surgery ," one replied.
I was pretty alarmed by that response. It seems that the graduates of today are increasingly willing to go under the knife to get ahead of others when it comes to getting a job .
One girl told me that she was considering surgery to increase her height. "They break your legs, put in special extending screws, and slowly expand the gap between the two ends of the bone as it re-grows, you can get at least 5 cm taller!"
At that point, I was shocked. I am short, I can't deny that, but I don't think I would put myself through months of agony just to be a few centimetres taller. I don't even bother to wear shoes with thick soles, as I'm not trying to hide the fact that I am just not tall!
It seems to me that there is a trend towards wanting "perfection" , and that is an ideal that just does not exist in reality.

Passage:
The advertisement appeared in my e-mail--"1-800-Flowers: Mother's Day Madness --for just $39.99!" I almost clicked on it, forgetting that those services would not be needed this year. My mother, Margaret Feiddman, died at the age of 89, and so this is my first Mother's Day without my mom.
In my childhood, my mom appeared to be a typical suburban housewife of her generation. She sewed many of my sisters' clothes, including both of their wedding dresses and boy's suits for me. And on the side, she won several national bridge tournaments .
My mom left many indelible marks on me. The first was to never lose heart and to be independent. My dad died suddenly when I was 19. My mom worked hard for a couple of years. But in1975, I won a scholarship to study in Britain and my mom surprised us all by announcing that she decided to go with me. When I met difficulties, she always said: "You're a man, so never lose heart, never be knocked down, and try your best to pursue  your dreams."

And on the side, she won several national bridge tournaments .\nMy mom left many indelible marks on me. The first was to never lose heart and to be independent. My dad died suddenly when I was 19. My mom worked hard for a couple of years. But in1975, I won a scholarship to study in Britain and my mom surprised us all by announcing that she decided to go with me. When I met difficulties, she always said: \"You're a man, so never lose heart, never be knocked down, and try your best to pursue  your dreams.\"\nMy mom's other big influence on me is a sense of optimism. She had taken her knocks. But every time life knocked her down, she got up and kept on marching forward, encouraged by the saying that pessimists  are usually right, optimists are usually wrong, but most great changes are made by optimists.\nHow I wish to listen to my mother's words, and give my best regards on this Mother's Day, but I have no chance now! My best friends, treasure your mother's love!\n\nQuestion:\nWhich can be the best title for the passage?\n\nOptions:\nA: My Great Mother\nB: Mother and I\nC: Treasure Mother's Love\nD: Mother's Day Madness\n\n\nYour Answer:", "role": "user", "name": null, "raw": false}], "model": "rwkv", "stream": false, "stop": ["\n\nUser", "\n\nQuestion", "\n\nQ", "\n\nHuman", "\n\nBob", "\n\nAssistant", "\n\nAnswer", "\n\nA", "\n\nBot", "\n\nAlice", "\n\nObservation", "\n\nUser", "\n\nAss"], "tools": null, "tool_choice": "auto", "user_name": null, "assistant_name": null, "system_name": null, "presystem": false}

### FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES (DO NOT ANSWER) ###

--- EXAMPLE 1 (DO NOT ANSWER) START ---
Passage:
Last week I talked with some of my students about what they wanted to do after they graduated, and what kind of job prospects  they thought they had.
Given that I teach students who are training to be doctors, I was surprised do find that most thought that they would not be able to get the jobs they wanted without "outside help". "What kind of help is that?" I asked, expecting them to tell me that they would need a   or family friend to help them out.
"Surgery ," one replied.
I was pretty alarmed by that response. It seems that the graduates of today are increasingly willing to go under the knife to get ahead of others when it comes to getting a job .
One girl told me that she was considering surgery to increase her height. "They break your legs, put in special extending screws, and slowly expand the gap between the two ends of the bone as it re-grows, you can get at least 5 cm taller!"
At that point, I was shocked. I am short, I can't deny that, but I don't think I would put myself through months of agony just to be a few centimetres taller. I don't even bother to wear shoes with thick soles, as I'm not trying to hide the fact that I am just not tall!
It seems to me that there is a trend towards wanting "perfection" , and that is an ideal that just does not exist in reality.
No one is born perfect, yet magazines, TV shows and movies present images of thin, tall, beautiful people as being the norm. Advertisements for slimming aids, beauty treatments and cosmetic surgery clinics fill the pages of newspapers, further creating an idea that "perfection" is a requirement, and that it must be purchased, no matter what the cost. In my opinion, skills, rather than appearance, should determine how successful a person is in his/her chosen career.

These options can range anywhere from simply spreading test-takers out in a room, to expelling  a student, which will most likely hindertheir plans of getting into another college. One simple way to fix the problem is to scold the student when caught. They may be so scared or embarrassed that they never do it again. This is a risky way to prevent cheating in some cases, however, because it can possibly damage self-esteem. Another simple way to avoid cheating is to create many different kinds of the same test. This prohibits students from getting the answers off of a neighbor's test, but students still have the option of using other cheating tactics.\nThere may be a million ways to cheat and get away with it, but there are few times, if any, that it is justified. Cheating never has to be a necessity and is never worth compromising morals and losing years worth of working towards a degree. This problem is spreading throughout America; with everyone's help, it can be stopped.\n\nQuestion:\nWhich is the best title of this passage?\n\nOptions:\nA: To cheat or not to cheat\nB: Show your opinion on cheating\nC: Debates on cheating\nD: Different ways of cheating\n\n\nYour Answer:", "role": "user", "name": null, "raw": false}], "model": "rwkv", "stream": false, "stop": ["\n\nUser", "\n\nQuestion", "\n\nQ", "\n\nHuman", "\n\nBob", "\n\nAssistant", "\n\nAnswer", "\n\nA", "\n\nBot", "\n\nAlice", "\n\nObservation", "\n\nUser", "\n\nAss"], "tools": null, "tool_choice": "auto", "user_name": null, "assistant_name": null, "system_name": null, "presystem": false}

### FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES (DO NOT ANSWER) ###

--- EXAMPLE 1 (DO NOT ANSWER) START ---
Passage:
Last week I talked with some of my students about what they wanted to do after they graduated, and what kind of job prospects  they thought they had.
Given that I teach students who are training to be doctors, I was surprised do find that most thought that they would not be able to get the jobs they wanted without "outside help". "What kind of help is that?" I asked, expecting them to tell me that they would need a   or family friend to help them out.
"Surgery ," one replied.
I was pretty alarmed by that response. It seems that the graduates of today are increasingly willing to go under the knife to get ahead of others when it comes to getting a job .
One girl told me that she was considering surgery to increase her height. "They break your legs, put in special extending screws, and slowly expand the gap between the two ends of the bone as it re-grows, you can get at least 5 cm taller!"
At that point, I was shocked. I am short, I can't deny that, but I don't think I would put myself through months of agony just to be a few centimetres taller. I don't even bother to wear shoes with thick soles, as I'm not trying to hide the fact that I am just not tall!
It seems to me that there is a trend towards wanting "perfection" , and that is an ideal that just does not exist in reality.
No one is born perfect, yet magazines, TV shows and movies present images of thin, tall, beautiful people as being the norm. Advertisements for slimming aids, beauty treatments and cosmetic surgery clinics fill the pages of newspapers, further creating an idea that "perfection" is a requirement, and that it must be purchased, no matter what the cost. In my opinion, skills, rather than appearance, should determine how successful a person is in his/her chosen career.

### FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES (DO NOT ANSWER) ###

--- EXAMPLE 1 (DO NOT ANSWER) START ---
Passage:
Last week I talked with some of my students about what they wanted to do after they graduated, and what kind of job prospects  they thought they had.
Given that I teach students who are training to be doctors, I was surprised do find that most thought that they would not be able to get the jobs they wanted without "outside help". "What kind of help is that?" I asked, expecting them to tell me that they would need a   or family friend to help them out.
"Surgery ," one replied.
I was pretty alarmed by that response. It seems that the graduates of today are increasingly willing to go under the knife to get ahead of others when it comes to getting a job .
One girl told me that she was considering surgery to increase her height. "They break your legs, put in special extending screws, and slowly expand the gap between the two ends of the bone as it re-grows, you can get at least 5 cm taller!"
At that point, I was shocked. I am short, I can't deny that, but I don't think I would put myself through months of agony just to be a few centimetres taller. I don't even bother to wear shoes with thick soles, as I'm not trying to hide the fact that I am just not tall!
It seems to me that there is a trend towards wanting "perfection" , and that is an ideal that just does not exist in reality.
No one is born perfect, yet magazines, TV shows and movies present images of thin, tall, beautiful people as being the norm. Advertisements for slimming aids, beauty treatments and cosmetic surgery clinics fill the pages of newspapers, further creating an idea that "perfection" is a requirement, and that it must be purchased, no matter what the cost. In my opinion, skills, rather than appearance, should determine how successful a person is in his/her chosen career.

This may be true in certain instances, however, all students have these problems, and it is unfair to the students refrain  from cheating when the student who is dishonest receives a better grade. The majority of students who think cheating is acceptable may believe the reason for this is that sometimes students are unaware they are cheating, there is not enough time given for assignments, or that the information is too much for the course.\nIt may be difficult to accomplish, but cheating can be prevented. Teachers and professors have tried many options to stop cheating. These options can range anywhere from simply spreading test-takers out in a room, to expelling  a student, which will most likely hindertheir plans of getting into another college. One simple way to fix the problem is to scold the student when caught. They may be so scared or embarrassed that they never do it again. This is a risky way to prevent cheating in some cases, however, because it can possibly damage self-esteem. Another simple way to avoid cheating is to create many different kinds of the same test. This prohibits students from getting the answers off of a neighbor's test, but students still have the option of using other cheating tactics.\nThere may be a million ways to cheat and get away with it, but there are few times, if any, that it is justified. Cheating never has to be a necessity and is never worth compromising morals and losing years worth of working towards a degree. This problem is spreading throughout America; with everyone's help, it can be stopped.\n\nQuestion:\nWhat is the disadvantage of scolding the cheating students according to the passage?\n\nOptions:\nA: They may continue to cheat next time.\nB: They may be hurt mentally.\nC: They may use other cheating tactics.\nD: They may get on badly with their teachers.\n\n\nYour Answer:", "role": "user", "name": null, "raw": false}], "model": "rwkv", "stream": false, "stop": ["\n\nUser", "\n\nQuestion", "\n\nQ", "\n\nHuman", "\n\nBob", "\n\nAssistant", "\n\nAnswer", "\n\nA", "\n\nBot", "\n\nAlice", "\n\nObservation", "\n\nUser", "\n\nAss"], "tools": null, "tool_choice": "auto", "user_name": null, "assistant_name": null, "system_name": null, "presystem": false}

### FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES (DO NOT ANSWER) ###

--- EXAMPLE 1 (DO NOT ANSWER) START ---
Passage:
Last week I talked with some of my students about what they wanted to do after they graduated, and what kind of job prospects  they thought they had.
Given that I teach students who are training to be doctors, I was surprised do find that most thought that they would not be able to get the jobs they wanted without "outside help". "What kind of help is that?" I asked, expecting them to tell me that they would need a   or family friend to help them out.
"Surgery ," one replied.
I was pretty alarmed by that response. It seems that the graduates of today are increasingly willing to go under the knife to get ahead of others when it comes to getting a job .
One girl told me that she was considering surgery to increase her height. "They break your legs, put in special extending screws, and slowly expand the gap between the two ends of the bone as it re-grows, you can get at least 5 cm taller!"
At that point, I was shocked. I am short, I can't deny that, but I don't think I would put myself through months of agony just to be a few centimetres taller. I don't even bother to wear shoes with thick soles, as I'm not trying to hide the fact that I am just not tall!
It seems to me that there is a trend towards wanting "perfection" , and that is an ideal that just does not exist in reality.
No one is born perfect, yet magazines, TV shows and movies present images of thin, tall, beautiful people as being the norm. Advertisements for slimming aids, beauty treatments and cosmetic surgery clinics fill the pages of newspapers, further creating an idea that "perfection" is a requirement, and that it must be purchased, no matter what the cost. In my opinion, skills, rather than appearance, should determine how successful a person is in his/her chosen career.

Question:

The majority of students who think cheating is acceptable may believe the reason for this is that sometimes students are unaware they are cheating, there is not enough time given for assignments, or that the information is too much for the course.\nIt may be difficult to accomplish, but cheating can be prevented. Teachers and professors have tried many options to stop cheating. These options can range anywhere from simply spreading test-takers out in a room, to expelling  a student, which will most likely hindertheir plans of getting into another college. One simple way to fix the problem is to scold the student when caught. They may be so scared or embarrassed that they never do it again. This is a risky way to prevent cheating in some cases, however, because it can possibly damage self-esteem. Another simple way to avoid cheating is to create many different kinds of the same test. This prohibits students from getting the answers off of a neighbor's test, but students still have the option of using other cheating tactics.\nThere may be a million ways to cheat and get away with it, but there are few times, if any, that it is justified. Cheating never has to be a necessity and is never worth compromising morals and losing years worth of working towards a degree. This problem is spreading throughout America; with everyone's help, it can be stopped.\n\nQuestion:\nWhat is the author's attitude towards cheating?\n\nOptions:\nA: It is reasonable\nB: It is necessary\nC: it can be praised\nD: It must be prevented\n\n\nYour Answer:", "role": "user", "name": null, "raw": false}], "model": "rwkv", "stream": false, "stop": ["\n\nUser", "\n\nQuestion", "\n\nQ", "\n\nHuman", "\n\nBob", "\n\nAssistant", "\n\nAnswer", "\n\nA", "\n\nBot", "\n\nAlice", "\n\nObservation", "\n\nUser", "\n\nAss"], "tools": null, "tool_choice": "auto", "user_name": null, "assistant_name": null, "system_name": null, "presystem": false}

### FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES (DO NOT ANSWER) ###

--- EXAMPLE 1 (DO NOT ANSWER) START ---
Passage:
Last week I talked with some of my students about what they wanted to do after they graduated, and what kind of job prospects  they thought they had.
Given that I teach students who are training to be doctors, I was surprised do find that most thought that they would not be able to get the jobs they wanted without "outside help". "What kind of help is that?" I asked, expecting them to tell me that they would need a   or family friend to help them out.
"Surgery ," one replied.
I was pretty alarmed by that response. It seems that the graduates of today are increasingly willing to go under the knife to get ahead of others when it comes to getting a job .
One girl told me that she was considering surgery to increase her height. "They break your legs, put in special extending screws, and slowly expand the gap between the two ends of the bone as it re-grows, you can get at least 5 cm taller!"
At that point, I was shocked. I am short, I can't deny that, but I don't think I would put myself through months of agony just to be a few centimetres taller. I don't even bother to wear shoes with thick soles, as I'm not trying to hide the fact that I am just not tall!
It seems to me that there is a trend towards wanting "perfection" , and that is an ideal that just does not exist in reality.
No one is born perfect, yet magazines, TV shows and movies present images of thin, tall, beautiful people as being the norm. Advertisements for slimming aids, beauty treatments and cosmetic surgery clinics fill the pages of newspapers, further creating an idea that "perfection" is a requirement, and that it must be purchased, no matter what the cost. In my opinion, skills, rather than appearance, should determine how successful a person is in his/her chosen career.

### FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES (DO NOT ANSWER) ###

--- EXAMPLE 1 (DO NOT ANSWER) START ---
Passage:
Last week I talked with some of my students about what they wanted to do after they graduated, and what kind of job prospects  they thought they had.
Given that I teach students who are training to be doctors, I was surprised do find that most thought that they would not be able to get the jobs they wanted without "outside help". "What kind of help is that?" I asked, expecting them to tell me that they would need a   or family friend to help them out.
"Surgery ," one replied.
I was pretty alarmed by that response. It seems that the graduates of today are increasingly willing to go under the knife to get ahead of others when it comes to getting a job .
One girl told me that she was considering surgery to increase her height. "They break your legs, put in special extending screws, and slowly expand the gap between the two ends of the bone as it re-grows, you can get at least 5 cm taller!"
At that point, I was shocked. I am short, I can't deny that, but I don't think I would put myself through months of agony just to be a few centimetres taller. I don't even bother to wear shoes with thick soles, as I'm not trying to hide the fact that I am just not tall!
It seems to me that there is a trend towards wanting "perfection" , and that is an ideal that just does not exist in reality.
No one is born perfect, yet magazines, TV shows and movies present images of thin, tall, beautiful people as being the norm. Advertisements for slimming aids, beauty treatments and cosmetic surgery clinics fill the pages of newspapers, further creating an idea that "perfection" is a requirement, and that it must be purchased, no matter what the cost. In my opinion, skills, rather than appearance, should determine how successful a person is in his/her chosen career.

Given that I teach students who are training to be doctors, I was surprised do find that most thought that they would not be able to get the jobs they wanted without "outside help". "What kind of help is that?" I asked, expecting them to tell me that they would need a   or family friend to help them out.
"Surgery ," one replied.
I was pretty alarmed by that response. It seems that the graduates of today are increasingly willing to go under the knife to get ahead of others when it comes to getting a job .
One girl told me that she was considering surgery to increase her height. "They break your legs, put in special extending screws, and slowly expand the gap between the two ends of the bone as it re-grows, you can get at least 5 cm taller!"
At that point, I was shocked. I am short, I can't deny that, but I don't think I would put myself through months of agony just to be a few centimetres taller. I don't even bother to wear shoes with thick soles, as I'm not trying to hide the fact that I am just not tall!
It seems to me that there is a trend towards wanting "perfection" , and that is an ideal that just does not exist in reality.
No one is born perfect, yet magazines, TV shows and movies present images of thin, tall, beautiful people as being the norm. Advertisements for slimming aids, beauty treatments and cosmetic surgery clinics fill the pages of newspapers, further creating an idea that "perfection" is a requirement, and that it must be purchased, no matter what the cost. In my opinion, skills, rather than appearance, should determine how successful a person is in his/her chosen career.

Question:
We can know from the passage that the author works as a_.

Options:
A: doctor
B: model
C: teacher
D: reporter

### FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES (DO NOT ANSWER) ###

--- EXAMPLE 1 (DO NOT ANSWER) START ---
Passage:
Last week I talked with some of my students about what they wanted to do after they graduated, and what kind of job prospects  they thought they had.
Given that I teach students who are training to be doctors, I was surprised do find that most thought that they would not be able to get the jobs they wanted without "outside help". "What kind of help is that?" I asked, expecting them to tell me that they would need a   or family friend to help them out.
"Surgery ," one replied.
I was pretty alarmed by that response. It seems that the graduates of today are increasingly willing to go under the knife to get ahead of others when it comes to getting a job .
One girl told me that she was considering surgery to increase her height. "They break your legs, put in special extending screws, and slowly expand the gap between the two ends of the bone as it re-grows, you can get at least 5 cm taller!"
At that point, I was shocked. I am short, I can't deny that, but I don't think I would put myself through months of agony just to be a few centimetres taller. I don't even bother to wear shoes with thick soles, as I'm not trying to hide the fact that I am just not tall!
It seems to me that there is a trend towards wanting "perfection" , and that is an ideal that just does not exist in reality.

### FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES (DO NOT ANSWER) ###

--- EXAMPLE 1 (DO NOT ANSWER) START ---
Passage:
Last week I talked with some of my students about what they wanted to do after they graduated, and what kind of job prospects  they thought they had.
Given that I teach students who are training to be doctors, I was surprised do find that most thought that they would not be able to get the jobs they wanted without "outside help". "What kind of help is that?" I asked, expecting them to tell me that they would need a   or family friend to help them out.
"Surgery ," one replied.
I was pretty alarmed by that response. It seems that the graduates of today are increasingly willing to go under the knife to get ahead of others when it comes to getting a job .
One girl told me that she was considering surgery to increase her height. "They break your legs, put in special extending screws, and slowly expand the gap between the two ends of the bone as it re-grows, you can get at least 5 cm taller!"
At that point, I was shocked. I am short, I can't deny that, but I don't think I would put myself through months of agony just to be a few centimetres taller. I don't even bother to wear shoes with thick soles, as I'm not trying to hide the fact that I am just not tall!

### REAL QUESTION — ANSWER THIS ONLY ###
Passage:
Witchcraft was not made a capital offence in Britain until 1563 though it was disapproved by Pope Innocent VIII in 1484. From 1484 until around 1750, some 200,000 witches were burnt or hanged in Western Europe.
Most supposed witches were usually old women, and always poor. Any who were unfortunate enough to be an old woman with broken teeth, sunken cheeks and sockets and a hairy lip were assumed to possess the "Evil Eye". It was more the case if they also had a cat. Many unfortunate women were taken away on this sort of evidence and hanged.
Witch fever held East Anglia for 14 terrible months between 1645--1646. A man called Matthew Hopkins, an unsuccessful lawyer, contributed a lot! He became known as the "Witchfinder General". He had 68 people put to death in Bury St. Edmunds alone, and 19 hanged at Chelmsfor in a single day. After Chelmsford he set off for other countries. Much of Matthew Hopkins theories of telling a witch were based on Devil's Marks. He took a small mark to be a Devil's Mark and he used his "needle" to see if these marks were insensitive to pain. His "needle" was basically a trick so the unfortunate women never felt any pain.
There were other tests for witches. Mary Sutton of Bedford was put to the swimming test. With her thumbs tied to opposite big toes she was thrown into the river. If she floated she was guilty; if she sank, innocent. Poor Mary floated!
Though many of the acts againsts witchcraft were put to an end in 1736, witch hunting still went on. In 1863, a suspected male witch was drowned in a pond in Headingham, Essex and 1945 the body of an elderly farm laborer was found near the village of Meon Hill in Warwickshire. His throat had been cut and his body was pinned to the earth. The murder remains unsolved; however, the man was said, locally, to be a male witch. It seems that belief in witchcraft has not entirely died out.

Question:
A female witch was often found to be   _

Options:
A: a young lady
B: a lucky woman
C: an ugly woman
D: a blind girl

A man called Matthew Hopkins, an unsuccessful lawyer, contributed a lot! He became known as the \"Witchfinder General\". He had 68 people put to death in Bury St. Edmunds alone, and 19 hanged at Chelmsfor in a single day. After Chelmsford he set off for other countries. Much of Matthew Hopkins theories of telling a witch were based on Devil's Marks. He took a small mark to be a Devil's Mark and he used his \"needle\" to see if these marks were insensitive to pain. His \"needle\" was basically a trick so the unfortunate women never felt any pain.\nThere were other tests for witches. Mary Sutton of Bedford was put to the swimming test. With her thumbs tied to opposite big toes she was thrown into the river. If she floated she was guilty; if she sank, innocent. Poor Mary floated!\nThough many of the acts againsts witchcraft were put to an end in 1736, witch hunting still went on. In 1863, a suspected male witch was drowned in a pond in Headingham, Essex and 1945 the body of an elderly farm laborer was found near the village of Meon Hill in Warwickshire.

### FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES (DO NOT ANSWER) ###

--- EXAMPLE 1 (DO NOT ANSWER) START ---
Passage:
Last week I talked with some of my students about what they wanted to do after they graduated, and what kind of job prospects  they thought they had.
Given that I teach students who are training to be doctors, I was surprised do find that most thought that they would not be able to get the jobs they wanted without "outside help". "What kind of help is that?" I asked, expecting them to tell me that they would need a   or family friend to help them out.
"Surgery ," one replied.
I was pretty alarmed by that response. It seems that the graduates of today are increasingly willing to go under the knife to get ahead of others when it comes to getting a job .
One girl told me that she was considering surgery to increase her height. "They break your legs, put in special extending screws, and slowly expand the gap between the two ends of the bone as it re-grows, you can get at least 5 cm taller!"
At that point, I was shocked. I am short, I can't deny that, but I don't think I would put myself through months of agony just to be a few centimetres taller. I don't even bother to wear shoes with thick soles, as I'm not trying to hide the fact that I am just not tall!
It seems to me that there is a trend towards wanting "perfection" , and that is an ideal that just does not exist in reality.

Advertisements for slimming aids, beauty treatments and cosmetic surgery clinics fill the pages of newspapers, further creating an idea that "perfection" is a requirement, and that it must be purchased, no matter what the cost. In my opinion, skills, rather than appearance, should determine how successful a person is in his/her chosen career.

### REAL QUESTION — ANSWER THIS ONLY ###
Passage:
Witchcraft was not made a capital offence in Britain until 1563 though it was disapproved by Pope Innocent VIII in 1484. From 1484 until around 1750, some 200,000 witches were burnt or hanged in Western Europe.
Most supposed witches were usually old women, and always poor. Any who were unfortunate enough to be an old woman with broken teeth, sunken cheeks and sockets and a hairy lip were assumed to possess the "Evil Eye". It was more the case if they also had a cat. Many unfortunate women were taken away on this sort of evidence and hanged.
Witch fever held East Anglia for 14 terrible months between 1645--1646. A man called Matthew Hopkins, an unsuccessful lawyer, contributed a lot! He became known as the "Witchfinder General". He had 68 people put to death in Bury St. Edmunds alone, and 19 hanged at Chelmsfor in a single day. After Chelmsford he set off for other countries. Much of Matthew Hopkins theories of telling a witch were based on Devil's Marks. He took a small mark to be a Devil's Mark and he used his "needle" to see if these marks were insensitive to pain. His "needle" was basically a trick so the unfortunate women never felt any pain.
There were other tests for witches. Mary Sutton of Bedford was put to the swimming test. With her thumbs tied to opposite big toes she was thrown into the river. If she floated she was guilty; if she sank, innocent. Poor Mary floated!
Though many of the acts againsts witchcraft were put to an end in 1736, witch hunting still went on. In 1863, a suspected male witch was drowned in a pond in Headingham, Essex and 1945 the body of an elderly farm laborer was found near the village of Meon Hill in Warwickshire. His throat had been cut and his body was pinned to the earth. The murder remains unsolved; however, the man was said, locally, to be a male witch. It seems that belief in witchcraft has not entirely died out.

Question:
Matthew Hopkins can be best described as   _

Options:
A: kind and smart
B: tricky and merciless
C: successful and nice
D: famous and fortunate

A man called Matthew Hopkins, an unsuccessful lawyer, contributed a lot! He became known as the \"Witchfinder General\". He had 68 people put to death in Bury St. Edmunds alone, and 19 hanged at Chelmsfor in a single day. After Chelmsford he set off for other countries. Much of Matthew Hopkins theories of telling a witch were based on Devil's Marks. He took a small mark to be a Devil's Mark and he used his \"needle\" to see if these marks were insensitive to pain. His \"needle\" was basically a trick so the unfortunate women never felt any pain.\nThere were other tests for witches. Mary Sutton of Bedford was put to the swimming test. With her thumbs tied to opposite big toes she was thrown into the river. If she floated she was guilty; if she sank, innocent. Poor Mary floated!\nThough many of the acts againsts witchcraft were put to an end in 1736, witch hunting still went on. In 1863, a suspected male witch was drowned in a pond in Headingham, Essex and 1945 the body of an elderly farm laborer was found near the village of Meon Hill in Warwickshire. His throat had been cut and his body was pinned to the earth. The murder remains unsolved; however, the man was said, locally, to be a male witch.

### FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES (DO NOT ANSWER) ###

--- EXAMPLE 1 (DO NOT ANSWER) START ---
Passage:
Last week I talked with some of my students about what they wanted to do after they graduated, and what kind of job prospects  they thought they had.
Given that I teach students who are training to be doctors, I was surprised do find that most thought that they would not be able to get the jobs they wanted without "outside help". "What kind of help is that?" I asked, expecting them to tell me that they would need a   or family friend to help them out.
"Surgery ," one replied.
I was pretty alarmed by that response. It seems that the graduates of today are increasingly willing to go under the knife to get ahead of others when it comes to getting a job .
One girl told me that she was considering surgery to increase her height. "They break your legs, put in special extending screws, and slowly expand the gap between the two ends of the bone as it re-grows, you can get at least 5 cm taller!"
At that point, I was shocked. I am short, I can't deny that, but I don't think I would put myself through months of agony just to be a few centimetres taller. I don't even bother to wear shoes with thick soles, as I'm not trying to hide the fact that I am just not tall!
It seems to me that there is a trend towards wanting "perfection" , and that is an ideal that just does not exist in reality.

Advertisements for slimming aids, beauty treatments and cosmetic surgery clinics fill the pages of newspapers, further creating an idea that "perfection" is a requirement, and that it must be purchased, no matter what the cost. In my opinion, skills, rather than appearance, should determine how successful a person is in his/her chosen career.

### REAL QUESTION — ANSWER THIS ONLY ###
Passage:
Witchcraft was not made a capital offence in Britain until 1563 though it was disapproved by Pope Innocent VIII in 1484. From 1484 until around 1750, some 200,000 witches were burnt or hanged in Western Europe.
Most supposed witches were usually old women, and always poor. Any who were unfortunate enough to be an old woman with broken teeth, sunken cheeks and sockets and a hairy lip were assumed to possess the "Evil Eye". It was more the case if they also had a cat. Many unfortunate women were taken away on this sort of evidence and hanged.
Witch fever held East Anglia for 14 terrible months between 1645--1646. A man called Matthew Hopkins, an unsuccessful lawyer, contributed a lot! He became known as the "Witchfinder General". He had 68 people put to death in Bury St. Edmunds alone, and 19 hanged at Chelmsfor in a single day. After Chelmsford he set off for other countries. Much of Matthew Hopkins theories of telling a witch were based on Devil's Marks. He took a small mark to be a Devil's Mark and he used his "needle" to see if these marks were insensitive to pain. His "needle" was basically a trick so the unfortunate women never felt any pain.
There were other tests for witches. Mary Sutton of Bedford was put to the swimming test. With her thumbs tied to opposite big toes she was thrown into the river. If she floated she was guilty; if she sank, innocent. Poor Mary floated!
Though many of the acts againsts witchcraft were put to an end in 1736, witch hunting still went on. In 1863, a suspected male witch was drowned in a pond in Headingham, Essex and 1945 the body of an elderly farm laborer was found near the village of Meon Hill in Warwickshire. His throat had been cut and his body was pinned to the earth. The murder remains unsolved; however, the man was said, locally, to be a male witch. It seems that belief in witchcraft has not entirely died out.

Question:
Why did people throw Mary into the river?

Options:
A: To take her life.
B: To tell if she was a witch
C: To test her swimming skills.
D: To prove that she was guilty

In my opinion, skills, rather than appearance, should determine how successful a person is in his/her chosen career.\n\nQuestion:\nAccording to the passage, the author believes that_.\n\nOptions:\nA: everyone should purchase perfection, whatever the cost\nB: it's right for graduates to ask for others to help them out in hunting for jobs\nC: it is one's appearance instead of skills that really matters in one's career\nD: media are to blame for misleading young people in their seeking for surgery\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n--- EXAMPLE 3 END ---\n\n\n\n### REAL QUESTION — ANSWER THIS ONLY ###\nPassage:\nWitchcraft was not made a capital offence in Britain until 1563 though it was disapproved by Pope Innocent VIII in 1484. From 1484 until around 1750, some 200,000 witches were burnt or hanged in Western Europe.\nMost supposed witches were usually old women, and always poor. Any who were unfortunate enough to be an old woman with broken teeth, sunken cheeks and sockets and a hairy lip were assumed to possess the \"Evil Eye\". It was more the case if they also had a cat. Many unfortunate women were taken away on this sort of evidence and hanged.\nWitch fever held East Anglia for 14 terrible months between 1645--1646. A man called Matthew Hopkins, an unsuccessful lawyer, contributed a lot! He became known as the \"Witchfinder General\". He had 68 people put to death in Bury St. Edmunds alone, and 19 hanged at Chelmsfor in a single day. After Chelmsford he set off for other countries. Much of Matthew Hopkins theories of telling a witch were based on Devil's Marks. He took a small mark to be a Devil's Mark and he used his \"needle\" to see if these marks were insensitive to pain. His \"needle\" was basically a trick so the unfortunate women never felt any pain.\nThere were other tests for witches. Mary Sutton of Bedford was put to the swimming test. With her thumbs tied to opposite big toes she was thrown into the river. If she floated she was guilty; if she sank, innocent. Poor Mary floated!\nThough many of the acts againsts witchcraft were put to an end in 1736, witch hunting still went on. In 1863, a suspected male witch was drowned in a pond in Headingham, Essex and 1945 the body of an elderly farm laborer was found near the village of Meon Hill in Warwickshire. His throat had been cut and his body was pinned to the earth. The murder remains unsolved; however, the man was said, locally, to be a male witch. It seems that belief in witchcraft has not entirely died out.\n\nQuestion:\nWhy did people throw Mary into the river?\n\nOptions:\nA: To take her life.\nB: To tell if she was a witch\nC: To test her swimming skills.\nD: To prove that she was guilty\n\n\nYour Answer:", "role": "user", "name": null, "raw": false}], "model": "rwkv", "stream": false, "stop": ["\n\nUser", "\n\nQuestion", "\n\nQ", "\n\nHuman", "\n\nBob", "\n\nAssistant", "\n\nAnswer", "\n\nA", "\n\nBot", "\n\nAlice", "\n\nObservation", "\n\nUser", "\n\nAss"], "tools": null, "tool_choice": "auto", "user_name": null, "assistant_name": null, "system_name": null, "presystem": false}
