Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of
 love and lust

Question:
Why does Deirdre get so upset when Blake Past suggests she go to prom with the young man?

Options:
A: Because Blake is trying to guilt Deirdre into going with the young man by telling her that it'll ease her conscience. 
B: Because Deirdre has fallen in love with Blake, despite his age, and wants him to take her to the prom.  
C: Because Blake is acting like he's her father, which is a sensitive topic for Deirdre because she lost her real parents. 
D: Because the young man gave up his right arm in order to afford tickets to the prom, and this disgusts Deirdre.

### REAL QUESTION — ANSWER THIS ONLY ###
Passage:
Folie ࠎ 

         People with high IQs tend to be nearsighted. This is not because they read a lot or stare at computer screens too much. That common-sense hypothesis has been discredited by research. Rather, it is a matter of genetics. The same genes that tend to elevate IQ also tend to affect the shape of the eyeball in a way that leads to myopia. This relationship--known in genetics as "pleiotropy"--seems to be completely accidental, a quirk of evolution. 

         Could there be a similar pleiotropy between madness and mathematics? Reading this absolutely fascinating biography by Sylvia Nasar, an economics writer for the New York Times , I began to wonder. Its subject, John Nash, is a mathematical genius who went crazy at the age of 30 and then, after several decades of flamboyant lunacy, was awarded the Nobel Prize in economics for something he had discovered as a graduate student. (He is now about to turn 70.) Nash is among the latest in a long and distinguished line of mathematicians--stretching back to that morbid paranoiac, Isaac Newton--who have been certifiably insane during parts of their lives. 

         Just in the last 100 years or so, most of the heroic figures in the foundations of mathematics have landed in mental asylums or have died by their own hand. The greatest of them, Kurt Gödel, starved himself to death in the belief that his colleagues were putting poison in his food. Of the two pioneers of game theory--the field in which Nash garnered his Nobel-

This is not because they read a lot or stare at computer screens too much. That common-sense hypothesis has been discredited by research. Rather, it is a matter of genetics. The same genes that tend to elevate IQ also tend to affect the shape of the eyeball in a way that leads to myopia. This relationship--known in genetics as \"pleiotropy\"--seems to be completely accidental, a quirk of evolution. \n\n         Could there be a similar pleiotropy between madness and mathematics? Reading this absolutely fascinating biography by Sylvia Nasar, an economics writer for the New York Times , I began to wonder. Its subject, John Nash, is a mathematical genius who went crazy at the age of 30 and then, after several decades of flamboyant lunacy, was awarded the Nobel Prize in economics for something he had discovered as a graduate student. (He is now about to turn 70.) Nash is among the latest in a long and distinguished line of mathematicians--stretching back to that morbid paranoiac, Isaac Newton--who have been certifiably insane during parts of their lives. \n\n         Just in the last 100 years or so, most of the heroic figures in the foundations of mathematics have landed in mental asylums or have died by their own hand. The greatest of them, Kurt Gödel, starved himself to death in the belief that his colleagues were putting poison in his food. Of the two pioneers of game theory--the field in which Nash garnered his Nobel-\n\nQuestion:\nWhat does the author hypothesize is connected in human genetics?\n\nOptions:\nA: Storytelling and madness\nB: Madness and math abilities\nC: Madness and math abilities, eye color and IQ\nD: Political activism and math abilities\n\n\nYour Answer:", "role": "user", "name": null, "raw": false}], "model": "rwkv", "stream": false, "stop": ["\n\nUser", "\n\nQuestion", "\n\nQ", "\n\nHuman", "\n\nBob", "\n\nAssistant", "\n\nAnswer", "\n\nA", "\n\nBot", "\n\nAlice", "\n\nObservation", "\n\nUser", "\n\nAss"], "tools": null, "tool_choice": "auto", "user_name": null, "assistant_name": null, "system_name": null, "presystem": false}

Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of
 love and lust

Question:
Why does Deirdre get so upset when Blake Past suggests she go to prom with the young man?

Options:
A: Because Blake is trying to guilt Deirdre into going with the young man by telling her that it'll ease her conscience. 
B: Because Deirdre has fallen in love with Blake, despite his age, and wants him to take her to the prom.  
C: Because Blake is acting like he's her father, which is a sensitive topic for Deirdre because she lost her real parents. 
D: Because the young man gave up his right arm in order to afford tickets to the prom, and this disgusts Deirdre.

### REAL QUESTION — ANSWER THIS ONLY ###
Passage:
Diamonds in the Rough 

         Fourscore and seven years ago, the first steel and concrete baseball palace opened for business. Philadelphia's Shibe Park, home to the Athletics and later the Phillies, was one of 13 urban ballparks built in the seven-year period now regarded as the golden age of ballpark architecture. All but three (Wrigley Field, Fenway Park, and Tiger Stadium) have since been razed. 

          Replacing parks built of wood, these ballyards set new standards for size, fire safety, intimacy, and convenience. As places to watch ballgames, they were vastly superior to the post-World War II parks, especially the facilities designed in the late '60s and '70s that doubled as football stadiums. But these concrete monsters, plopped into vast parking lots in Houston, Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Philadelphia, and elsewhere, lack the character of the classic parks. 

         Chicago's New Comiskey Park, which opened in 1991, attempted to address the character question with a superficial postmodern facade that in some ways resembled the exterior of the golden-era park it replaced. New Comiskey was marketed as an old-fashioned park with all the modern conveniences. But inside, it was still a symmetrical concrete monster, and it sat in the middle of a 7,000-car parking lot rather than in an urban neighborhood. 

         A year later, a new--yet more genuinely old--ballpark arrived to dispel the gloom. Baltimore's Oriole Park at Camden Yards revived the idea of a quirkily 

Question:
What is the difference between how baseball stadiums used to be paid for and how they are paid for at the time of this writing?

Options:
A: They have always been paid for by stadium owners, and the owners now have so much more money they can upgrade the parks
B: They were paid for by team owners, and now mostly by taxpayers
C: They have always been paid by taxpayers, but now there is more tax money going towards it
D: They used to be payed for by taxes, but as they became more expensive the team owners began having to pay for them

C: Because Blake is acting like he's her father, which is a sensitive topic for Deirdre because she lost her real parents.

### REAL QUESTION — ANSWER THIS ONLY ###
Passage:
My Father's Estate 

         A letter from an ill-mannered former high-school classmate of long ago, one of several like it, which I pass on in paraphrase: "I saw that your father had died," she wrote. "He was always so clever about money. Did he leave you a big estate? Did he figure out a way around the estate tax?" It's a rude question, but it has an answer. 

         My sister and I have been going through my father's estate lately with his lawyer, and we're pawing through old, dusty files to find bank account numbers and rules for annuities, so maybe it's a good time to think about what my father, Herbert Stein, left to us. 

         He did indeed leave some money. By the standards we read about in the Wall Street Journal or Sports Illustrated , it was not worthy of much ink. In any event, because of the class-warfare-based death tax, the amount that will be left is vastly less than what he had saved. As an economist, my father was famous for defending taxes as a necessary evil. But even he was staggered, not long before his death, when he considered the taxes on his savings that would go to the Internal Revenue Service. 

         The nest egg is going to be taxed at a federal rate of about 55 percent, after an initial exemption and then a transition amount taxed at around 40 percent (and all that after paying estate expenses). When I think about it, I want to cry. My father and mother lived frugally all their lives. They never had a luxury car. They never flew first-

Question:
What did the author outline as the importance of friendships to his father?

Options:
A: His friends were essential in his early career days, but he lost touch with most through raising his family
B: He didn’t keep many friends at the end of his life
C: He kept friends even from early school days throughout his life and they were very important to him even as he became busy through life
D: He did not value friendships, and often felt regretful later in life that he hadn’t

THE GIRL IN HIS MIND
By ROBERT F. YOUNG


 [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from

Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of
 love and lust

### REAL QUESTION — ANSWER THIS ONLY ###
Passage:
My Father's Estate 

         A letter from an ill-mannered former high-school classmate of long ago, one of several like it, which I pass on in paraphrase: "I saw that your father had died," she wrote. "He was always so clever about money. Did he leave you a big estate? Did he figure out a way around the estate tax?" It's a rude question, but it has an answer. 

         My sister and I have been going through my father's estate lately with his lawyer, and we're pawing through old, dusty files to find bank account numbers and rules for annuities, so maybe it's a good time to think about what my father, Herbert Stein, left to us. 

         He did indeed leave some money. By the standards we read about in the Wall Street Journal or Sports Illustrated , it was not worthy of much ink.

As an economist, my father was famous for defending taxes as a necessary evil. But even he was staggered, not long before his death, when he considered the taxes on his savings that would go to the Internal Revenue Service. 

         The nest egg is going to be taxed at a federal rate of about 55 percent, after an initial exemption and then a transition amount taxed at around 40 percent (and all that after paying estate expenses).

Passage:
My Father's Estate 

         A letter from an ill-mannered former high-school classmate of long ago, one of several like it, which I pass on in paraphrase: "I saw that your father had died," she wrote. "He was always so clever about money. Did he leave you a big estate? Did he figure out a way around the estate tax?" It's a rude question, but it has an answer. 

         My sister and I have been going through my father's estate lately with his lawyer, and we're pawing through old, dusty files to find bank account numbers and rules for annuities, so maybe it's a good time to think about what my father, Herbert Stein, left to us. 

         He did indeed leave some money. By the standards we read about in the Wall Street Journal or Sports Illustrated , it was not worthy of much ink. In any event, because of the class-warfare-based death tax, the amount that will be left is vastly less than what he had saved. As an economist, my father was famous for defending taxes as a necessary evil. But even he was staggered, not long before his death, when he considered the taxes on his savings that would go to the Internal Revenue Service. 

         The nest egg is going to be taxed at a federal rate of about 55 percent, after an initial exemption and then a transition amount taxed at around 40 percent (and all that after paying estate expenses). When I think about it, I want to cry. My father and mother lived frugally all their lives. They never had a luxury car. They never flew first-

Question:

Passage:
THE GIRL IN HIS MIND
By ROBERT F. YOUNG


 [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from

 Worlds of Tomorrow April 1963

 Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that

 the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]
Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of
 love and lust

Question:
How much time has passed between Blake's night with Eldoria and his search for Sabrina York in his mind-world?

Options:
A: 7 years
B: 10 hours
C: 12 years
D: 1 hour

### REAL QUESTION — ANSWER THIS ONLY ###
Passage:
My Father's Estate 

         A letter from an ill-mannered former high-school classmate of long ago, one of several like it, which I pass on in paraphrase: "I saw that your father had died," she wrote. "He was always so clever about money. Did he leave you a big estate? Did he figure out a way around the estate tax?" It's a rude question, but it has an answer. 

         My sister and I have been going through my father's estate lately with his lawyer, and we're pawing through old, dusty files to find bank account numbers and rules for annuities, so maybe it's a good time to think about what my father, Herbert Stein, left to us. 

         He did indeed leave some money. By the standards we read about in the Wall Street Journal or Sports Illustrated , it was not worthy of much ink. In any event, because of the class-warfare-based death tax, the amount that will be left is vastly less than what he had saved. As an economist, my father was famous for defending taxes as a necessary evil. But even he was staggered, not long before his death, when he considered the taxes on his savings that would go to the Internal Revenue Service. 

         The nest egg is going to be taxed at a federal rate of about 55 percent, after an initial exemption and then a transition amount taxed at around 40 percent (and all that after paying estate expenses). When I think about it, I want to cry. My father and mother lived frugally all their lives. They never had a luxury car. They never flew first-

Question:
What does the author explain was his father’s opinions on status?

Options:
A: He was never able to reach status and he resented those with it
B: He sought to achieve status in life and pass on wealth
C: Status was less important to him than friendships
D: He respected status and the power that is brought to the holder

Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of
 love and lust

C: Because Blake is acting like he's her father, which is a sensitive topic for Deirdre because she lost her real parents.

### REAL QUESTION — ANSWER THIS ONLY ###
Passage:
My Father's Estate 

         A letter from an ill-mannered former high-school classmate of long ago, one of several like it, which I pass on in paraphrase: "I saw that your father had died," she wrote. "He was always so clever about money. Did he leave you a big estate? Did he figure out a way around the estate tax?" It's a rude question, but it has an answer. 

         My sister and I have been going through my father's estate lately with his lawyer, and we're pawing through old, dusty files to find bank account numbers and rules for annuities, so maybe it's a good time to think about what my father, Herbert Stein, left to us. 

         He did indeed leave some money. By the standards we read about in the Wall Street Journal or Sports Illustrated , it was not worthy of much ink. In any event, because of the class-warfare-based death tax, the amount that will be left is vastly less than what he had saved. As an economist, my father was famous for defending taxes as a necessary evil. But even he was staggered, not long before his death, when he considered the taxes on his savings that would go to the Internal Revenue Service. 

         The nest egg is going to be taxed at a federal rate of about 55 percent, after an initial exemption and then a transition amount taxed at around 40 percent (and all that after paying estate expenses). When I think about it, I want to cry. My father and mother lived frugally all their lives. They never had a luxury car. They never flew first-

Question:
What are some of the things the author says can’t easily be valued?

Options:
A: The antique car collection
B: The furniture in his home
C: The values that his children cherish
D: The various properties his father owned that are meaningful to the family

### REAL QUESTION — ANSWER THIS ONLY ###
Passage:
My Father's Estate 

         A letter from an ill-mannered former high-school classmate of long ago, one of several like it, which I pass on in paraphrase: "I saw that your father had died," she wrote. "He was always so clever about money. Did he leave you a big estate? Did he figure out a way around the estate tax?" It's a rude question, but it has an answer. 

         My sister and I have been going through my father's estate lately with his lawyer, and we're pawing through old, dusty files to find bank account numbers and rules for annuities, so maybe it's a good time to think about what my father, Herbert Stein, left to us. 

         He did indeed leave some money. By the standards we read about in the Wall Street Journal or Sports Illustrated , it was not worthy of much ink. In any event, because of the class-warfare-based death tax, the amount that will be left is vastly less than what he had saved. As an economist, my father was famous for defending taxes as a necessary evil. But even he was staggered, not long before his death, when he considered the taxes on his savings that would go to the Internal Revenue Service. 

         The nest egg is going to be taxed at a federal rate of about 55 percent, after an initial exemption and then a transition amount taxed at around 40 percent (and all that after paying estate expenses). When I think about it, I want to cry. My father and mother lived frugally all their lives. They never had a luxury car. They never flew first-

Question:
What was the relationship like between the son and his mother?

Options:
A: His mother needed to make decisions about the estate when his father passed and he was in disagreement about how they should be made
B: Their relationship seems to have been pleasant and he knows how much she meant to his father
C: His mother needed a lot of help when his father passed away and he was happy to be there for her
D: She passed away early in her son’s life

Every man's mind is a universe with countless

The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7

 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of

Passage:
My Father's Estate 

         A letter from an ill-mannered former high-school classmate of long ago, one of several like it, which I pass on in paraphrase: "I saw that your father had died," she wrote. "He was always so clever about money. Did he leave you a big estate? Did he figure out a way around the estate tax?" It's a rude question, but it has an answer. 

         My sister and I have been going through my father's estate lately with his lawyer, and we're pawing through old, dusty files to find bank account numbers and rules for annuities, so maybe it's a good time to think about what my father, Herbert Stein, left to us. 

         He did indeed leave some money. By the standards we read about in the Wall Street Journal or Sports Illustrated , it was not worthy of much ink. In any event, because of the class-warfare-based death tax, the amount that will be left is vastly less than what he had saved. As an economist, my father was famous for defending taxes as a necessary evil. But even he was staggered, not long before his death, when he considered the taxes on his savings that would go to the Internal Revenue Service. 

         The nest egg is going to be taxed at a federal rate of about 55 percent, after an initial exemption and then a transition amount taxed at around 40 percent (and all that after paying estate expenses).

THE GIRL IN HIS MIND
By ROBERT F. YOUNG


 [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from

 Worlds of Tomorrow April 1963

 Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that

 the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]
Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of
 love and lust

Question:
How much time has passed between Blake's night with Eldoria and his search for Sabrina York in his mind-world?

B: 10 hours

### REAL QUESTION — ANSWER THIS ONLY ###
Passage:
My Father's Estate 

         A letter from an ill-mannered former high-school classmate of long ago, one of several like it, which I pass on in paraphrase: "I saw that your father had died," she wrote. "He was always so clever about money. Did he leave you a big estate? Did he figure out a way around the estate tax?" It's a rude question, but it has an answer. 

         My sister and I have been going through my father's estate lately with his lawyer, and we're pawing through old, dusty files to find bank account numbers and rules for annuities, so maybe it's a good time to think about what my father, Herbert Stein, left to us. 

         He did indeed leave some money. By the standards we read about in the Wall Street Journal or Sports Illustrated , it was not worthy of much ink. In any event, because of the class-warfare-based death tax, the amount that will be left is vastly less than what he had saved. As an economist, my father was famous for defending taxes as a necessary evil. But even he was staggered, not long before his death, when he considered the taxes on his savings that would go to the Internal Revenue Service. 

         The nest egg is going to be taxed at a federal rate of about 55 percent, after an initial exemption and then a transition amount taxed at around 40 percent (and all that after paying estate expenses). When I think about it, I want to cry. My father and mother lived frugally all their lives. They never had a luxury car. They never flew first-

Question:
What personal feelings did the author have about the estate tax on his father’s estate?

Options:
A: He believed that people who invest in land like his father should be able to pass property on without tax
B: His parents lived cheaply and the author feels they deserve to have their savings passed on
C: His parents passed a lot of money on while they were alive, and he feels like he has received plenty and doesn’t need to worry about estate tax
D: He believes it is important that his father’s estate does go in part to the IRS to support the public services his father was a part of creating

The goal is to find an incriminating datum that will leave a permanent stain on the target\'s reputation, make his defenders look like craven apologists, and give the general public a ready-made judgment that can be wielded without too much reading or thought. If the anti-communism of George Orwell or Arthur Koestler bugs you, you can point to recent allegations that the former was a snitch and the latter a rapist. If you resent the fact that your college professors forced you to read I, Rigoberta Mench\\u00c3\\u00ba , you can rejoice in the discovery that she embellished some important details of her life story. Didn\'t Karl Marx beat his wife? And what about Freud\'s thing for his sister-in-law and his taste for cocaine? \\n\\n         To this list now add Columbia literature professor Edward W. Said, the subject of a fiercely debated article in the September issue of Commentary . The article, by American-born Israeli legal scholar Justus Reid Weiner, contends that Said, who was born in Jerusalem to a Christian Arab family in 1935, has over the years deliberately obscured some facts about his early life, and amplified others, in order to create the impression that he was, of all things, Palestinian. \\n\\n         Not so fast, says Weiner: Said\'s childhood was not \\"the parable of Palestinian identity\\" marked by dispossession from a beloved homeland and the subsequent pain of exile\\n\\nQuestion:\\nWhat does the author suggest are some traits Said possesses?\\n\\nOptions:\\nA: Boldness, confidence\\nB: Vanity, disorganization\\nC: Inventiveness, shyness\\nD: Charisma, people-pleasing\\n\\n\\nYour Answer:", "raw": false}], "stream": false, "max_tokens": 5, "temperature": 0.0}'

Passage:
THE GIRL IN HIS MIND
By ROBERT F. YOUNG


 [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from

 Worlds of Tomorrow April 1963

 Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that

 the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]
Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of
 love and lust

Question:
How much time has passed between Blake's night with Eldoria and his search for Sabrina York in his mind-world?

Options:
A: 7 years
B: 10 hours
C: 12 years
D: 1 hour

Correct Answer: B

Question:
Why does Deirdre get so upset when Blake Past suggests she go to prom with the young man?

Options:
A: Because Blake is trying to guilt Deirdre into going with the young man by telling her that it'll ease her conscience. 
B: Because Deirdre has fallen in love with Blake, despite his age, and wants him to take her to the prom.  
C: Because Blake is acting like he's her father, which is a sensitive topic for Deirdre because she lost her real parents. 
D: Because the young man gave up his right arm in order to afford tickets to the prom, and this disgusts Deirdre.

### REAL QUESTION — ANSWER THIS ONLY ###
Passage:
Edward W. Said 

         The game of biographical "gotcha" is a perennially popular form of ideological blood sport. The goal is to find an incriminating datum that will leave a permanent stain on the target's reputation, make his defenders look like craven apologists, and give the general public a ready-made judgment that can be wielded without too much reading or thought. If the anti-communism of George Orwell or Arthur Koestler bugs you, you can point to recent allegations that the former was a snitch and the latter a rapist. If you resent the fact that your college professors forced you to read I, Rigoberta MenchÃº , you can rejoice in the discovery that she embellished some important details of her life story. Didn't Karl Marx beat his wife? And what about Freud's thing for his sister-in-law and his taste for cocaine? 

         To this list now add Columbia literature professor Edward W. Said, the subject of a fiercely debated article in the September issue of Commentary . The article, by American-born Israeli legal scholar Justus Reid Weiner, contends that Said, who was born in Jerusalem to a Christian Arab family in 1935, has over the years deliberately obscured some facts about his early life, and amplified others, in order to create the impression that he was, of all things, Palestinian. 

         Not so fast, says Weiner: Said's childhood was not "the parable of Palestinian identity" marked by dispossession from a beloved homeland and the subsequent pain of exile

Question:
What does the author suggest are some traits Said possesses?

Options:
A: Boldness, confidence
B: Vanity, disorganization
C: Inventiveness, shyness
D: Charisma, people-pleasing

### REAL QUESTION — ANSWER THIS ONLY ###
Passage:
Edward W. Said 

         The game of biographical "gotcha" is a perennially popular form of ideological blood sport. The goal is to find an incriminating datum that will leave a permanent stain on the target's reputation, make his defenders look like craven apologists, and give the general public a ready-made judgment that can be wielded without too much reading or thought. If the anti-communism of George Orwell or Arthur Koestler bugs you, you can point to recent allegations that the former was a snitch and the latter a rapist. If you resent the fact that your college professors forced you to read I, Rigoberta MenchÃº , you can rejoice in the discovery that she embellished some important details of her life story. Didn't Karl Marx beat his wife? And what about Freud's thing for his sister-in-law and his taste for cocaine? 

         To this list now add Columbia literature professor Edward W. Said, the subject of a fiercely debated article in the September issue of Commentary . The article, by American-born Israeli legal scholar Justus Reid Weiner, contends that Said, who was born in Jerusalem to a Christian Arab family in 1935, has over the years deliberately obscured some facts about his early life, and amplified others, in order to create the impression that he was, of all things, Palestinian. 

         Not so fast, says Weiner: Said's childhood was not "the parable of Palestinian identity" marked by dispossession from a beloved homeland and the subsequent pain of exile

Question:
What is Said’s most famous contribution in literature?

Options:

### REAL QUESTION — ANSWER THIS ONLY ###
Passage:
Edward W. Said 

         The game of biographical "gotcha" is a perennially popular form of ideological blood sport. The goal is to find an incriminating datum that will leave a permanent stain on the target's reputation, make his defenders look like craven apologists, and give the general public a ready-made judgment that can be wielded without too much reading or thought. If the anti-communism of George Orwell or Arthur Koestler bugs you, you can point to recent allegations that the former was a snitch and the latter a rapist. If you resent the fact that your college professors forced you to read I, Rigoberta MenchÃº , you can rejoice in the discovery that she embellished some important details of her life story. Didn't Karl Marx beat his wife? And what about Freud's thing for his sister-in-law and his taste for cocaine? 

         To this list now add Columbia literature professor Edward W. Said, the subject of a fiercely debated article in the September issue of Commentary . The article, by American-born Israeli legal scholar Justus Reid Weiner, contends that Said, who was born in Jerusalem to a Christian Arab family in 1935, has over the years deliberately obscured some facts about his early life, and amplified others, in order to create the impression that he was, of all things, Palestinian. 

         Not so fast, says Weiner: Said's childhood was not "the parable of Palestinian identity" marked by dispossession from a beloved homeland and the subsequent pain of exile

Question:
What does the author explain is Said’s main occupation?

Options:
A: Critiquing literature
B: Politician
C: International affairs
D: News anchor

### REAL QUESTION — ANSWER THIS ONLY ###
Passage:
Edward W. Said 

         The game of biographical "gotcha" is a perennially popular form of ideological blood sport. The goal is to find an incriminating datum that will leave a permanent stain on the target's reputation, make his defenders look like craven apologists, and give the general public a ready-made judgment that can be wielded without too much reading or thought. If the anti-communism of George Orwell or Arthur Koestler bugs you, you can point to recent allegations that the former was a snitch and the latter a rapist. If you resent the fact that your college professors forced you to read I, Rigoberta MenchÃº , you can rejoice in the discovery that she embellished some important details of her life story. Didn't Karl Marx beat his wife? And what about Freud's thing for his sister-in-law and his taste for cocaine? 

         To this list now add Columbia literature professor Edward W. Said, the subject of a fiercely debated article in the September issue of Commentary . The article, by American-born Israeli legal scholar Justus Reid Weiner, contends that Said, who was born in Jerusalem to a Christian Arab family in 1935, has over the years deliberately obscured some facts about his early life, and amplified others, in order to create the impression that he was, of all things, Palestinian. 

         Not so fast, says Weiner: Said's childhood was not "the parable of Palestinian identity" marked by dispossession from a beloved homeland and the subsequent pain of exile

Question:
What was Said’s relationship with Western media?

Options:
A: He never tried to engage with Western media due to his reputation
B: He remained aware of its importance, but chose not to use it as a venue
C: He was shunned by Western media and they would not pick up his work
D: He published in several Western magazines

THE GIRL IN HIS MIND
By ROBERT F. YOUNG


 [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from

 Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that

 the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]
Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of
 love and lust

Question:
How much time has passed between Blake's night with Eldoria and his search for Sabrina York in his mind-world?

### REAL QUESTION — ANSWER THIS ONLY ###
Passage:
Edward W. Said 

         The game of biographical "gotcha" is a perennially popular form of ideological blood sport. The goal is to find an incriminating datum that will leave a permanent stain on the target's reputation, make his defenders look like craven apologists, and give the general public a ready-made judgment that can be wielded without too much reading or thought. If the anti-communism of George Orwell or Arthur Koestler bugs you, you can point to recent allegations that the former was a snitch and the latter a rapist. If you resent the fact that your college professors forced you to read I, Rigoberta MenchÃº , you can rejoice in the discovery that she embellished some important details of her life story. Didn't Karl Marx beat his wife? And what about Freud's thing for his sister-in-law and his taste for cocaine? 

         To this list now add Columbia literature professor Edward W. Said, the subject of a fiercely debated article in the September issue of Commentary . The article, by American-born Israeli legal scholar Justus Reid Weiner, contends that Said, who was born in Jerusalem to a Christian Arab family in 1935, has over the years deliberately obscured some facts about his early life, and amplified others, in order to create the impression that he was, of all things, Palestinian. 

         Not so fast, says Weiner: Said's childhood was not "the parable of Palestinian identity" marked by dispossession from a beloved homeland and the subsequent pain of exile

Question:
How did Said deliver his most important works?

Options:
A: Cinema
B: Speeches
C: Books
D: Visual arts

The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted

Question:
Why does Deirdre get so upset when Blake Past suggests she go to prom with the young man?

Options:
A: Because Blake is trying to guilt Deirdre into going with the young man by telling her that it'll ease her conscience. 
B: Because Deirdre has fallen in love with Blake, despite his age, and wants him to take her to the prom.  
C: Because Blake is acting like he's her father, which is a sensitive topic for Deirdre because she lost her real parents. 
D: Because the young man gave up his right arm in order to afford tickets to the prom, and this disgusts Deirdre.

### REAL QUESTION — ANSWER THIS ONLY ###
Passage:
Edward W. Said 

         The game of biographical "gotcha" is a perennially popular form of ideological blood sport. The goal is to find an incriminating datum that will leave a permanent stain on the target's reputation, make his defenders look like craven apologists, and give the general public a ready-made judgment that can be wielded without too much reading or thought. If the anti-communism of George Orwell or Arthur Koestler bugs you, you can point to recent allegations that the former was a snitch and the latter a rapist. If you resent the fact that your college professors forced you to read I, Rigoberta MenchÃº , you can rejoice in the discovery that she embellished some important details of her life story. Didn't Karl Marx beat his wife? And what about Freud's thing for his sister-in-law and his taste for cocaine? 

         To this list now add Columbia literature professor Edward W. Said, the subject of a fiercely debated article in the September issue of Commentary . The article, by American-born Israeli legal scholar Justus Reid Weiner, contends that Said, who was born in Jerusalem to a Christian Arab family in 1935, has over the years deliberately obscured some facts about his early life, and amplified others, in order to create the impression that he was, of all things, Palestinian. 

         Not so fast, says Weiner: Said's childhood was not "the parable of Palestinian identity" marked by dispossession from a beloved homeland and the subsequent pain of exile

Question:
Which of the following was NOT related to Said’s life as told in the article?

Options:
A: Elected into the American political system
B: Critiques of Western literature, culture, art
C: Israel’s right to exist
D: Professorial roles

### REAL QUESTION — ANSWER THIS ONLY ###
Passage:
Edward W. Said 

         The game of biographical "gotcha" is a perennially popular form of ideological blood sport. The goal is to find an incriminating datum that will leave a permanent stain on the target's reputation, make his defenders look like craven apologists, and give the general public a ready-made judgment that can be wielded without too much reading or thought. If the anti-communism of George Orwell or Arthur Koestler bugs you, you can point to recent allegations that the former was a snitch and the latter a rapist. If you resent the fact that your college professors forced you to read I, Rigoberta MenchÃº , you can rejoice in the discovery that she embellished some important details of her life story. Didn't Karl Marx beat his wife? And what about Freud's thing for his sister-in-law and his taste for cocaine? 

         To this list now add Columbia literature professor Edward W. Said, the subject of a fiercely debated article in the September issue of Commentary . The article, by American-born Israeli legal scholar Justus Reid Weiner, contends that Said, who was born in Jerusalem to a Christian Arab family in 1935, has over the years deliberately obscured some facts about his early life, and amplified others, in order to create the impression that he was, of all things, Palestinian. 

         Not so fast, says Weiner: Said's childhood was not "the parable of Palestinian identity" marked by dispossession from a beloved homeland and the subsequent pain of exile

Question:
What reasons does the author give that Said’s actions might be controversial?

Options:
A: Political commentary
B: Independent publishing
C: University lectures
D: Fashion

By ROBERT F. YOUNG


 [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from

Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of
 love and lust

Question:
How much time has passed between Blake's night with Eldoria and his search for Sabrina York in his mind-world?

Edward W. Said 

         The game of biographical "gotcha" is a perennially popular form of ideological blood sport. The goal is to find an incriminating datum that will leave a permanent stain on the target's reputation, make his defenders look like craven apologists, and give the general public a ready-made judgment that can be wielded without too much reading or thought. If the anti-communism of George Orwell or Arthur Koestler bugs you, you can point to recent allegations that the former was a snitch and the latter a rapist. If you resent the fact that your college professors forced you to read I, Rigoberta MenchÃº , you can rejoice in the discovery that she embellished some important details of her life story. Didn't Karl Marx beat his wife? And what about Freud's thing for his sister-in-law and his taste for cocaine? 

         To this list now add Columbia literature professor Edward W. Said, the subject of a fiercely debated article in the September issue of Commentary . The article, by American-born Israeli legal scholar Justus Reid Weiner, contends that Said, who was born in Jerusalem to a Christian Arab family in 1935, has over the years deliberately obscured some facts about his early life, and amplified others, in order to create the impression that he was, of all things, Palestinian. 

         Not so fast, says Weiner: Said's childhood was not "the parable of Palestinian identity" marked by dispossession from a beloved homeland and the subsequent pain of exile

Question:
What is the relationship like between Said and Weiner?

### REAL QUESTION — ANSWER THIS ONLY ###
Passage:
Edward W. Said 

         The game of biographical "gotcha" is a perennially popular form of ideological blood sport. The goal is to find an incriminating datum that will leave a permanent stain on the target's reputation, make his defenders look like craven apologists, and give the general public a ready-made judgment that can be wielded without too much reading or thought. If the anti-communism of George Orwell or Arthur Koestler bugs you, you can point to recent allegations that the former was a snitch and the latter a rapist. If you resent the fact that your college professors forced you to read I, Rigoberta MenchÃº , you can rejoice in the discovery that she embellished some important details of her life story. Didn't Karl Marx beat his wife? And what about Freud's thing for his sister-in-law and his taste for cocaine? 

         To this list now add Columbia literature professor Edward W. Said, the subject of a fiercely debated article in the September issue of Commentary . The article, by American-born Israeli legal scholar Justus Reid Weiner, contends that Said, who was born in Jerusalem to a Christian Arab family in 1935, has over the years deliberately obscured some facts about his early life, and amplified others, in order to create the impression that he was, of all things, Palestinian. 

         Not so fast, says Weiner: Said's childhood was not "the parable of Palestinian identity" marked by dispossession from a beloved homeland and the subsequent pain of exile

Question:
What is the outcome of the criticism that Said embellished his upbringing?

Options:
A: It boosts his level of fame
B: It causes controversy, but is overcome
C: It was never fully explained as the story went on to other subjects
D: It ruins his career

Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of

Passage:
Booze You Can Use 

         I love beer, but lately I've been wondering: Am I getting full value for my beer dollar? As I've stocked up on microbrews and fancy imports, I've told myself that their taste is deeper, richer, more complicated, more compelling--and therefore worth the 50 percent to 200 percent premium they command over cheap mass products or even mainstream Bud. And yet, I've started to wonder, is this just costly snobbery? If I didn't know what I was drinking, could I even tell whether it was something from Belgium, vs. something from Pabst? 

         I'm afraid we'll never know the answer to that exact question, since I'm not brave enough to expose my own taste to a real test. But I'm brave enough to expose my friends'. This summer, while working at Microsoft, I put out a call for volunteers for a "science of beer" experiment. Testing candidates had to meet two criteria: 1) they had to like beer; and 2) they had to think they knew the difference between mass products and high-end microbrews. 

         Twelve tasters were selected, mainly on the basis of essays detailing their background with beer. A few were selected because they had been bosses in the Microsoft department where I worked. All were software managers or developers ; all were male, but I repeat myself. Nearly half had grown up outside the United States or lived abroad for enough years to speak haughtily about American macrobrews. Most tasters came in talking big about the refinement of their pal

Question:
What is the plan for future experimentation?

Options:
A: The author has only one more experiment planned

C: The author has completed all the experiments they intend on doing
D: The author will do two more experiments - another repeat of lager, and one with more expensive options

Every man's mind is a universe with countless

The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the

Options:
A: He is embarrassed at the thought that Deirdre might enter the room while he is sleeping with Eldoria. 
B: He feels that prostitution is morally reprehensible. 
C: He feels guilty about sleeping with Eldoria when there's a child in the hut, Deirdre, who knows exactly what's going on.

### REAL QUESTION — ANSWER THIS ONLY ###
Passage:
Booze You Can Use 

         I love beer, but lately I've been wondering: Am I getting full value for my beer dollar? As I've stocked up on microbrews and fancy imports, I've told myself that their taste is deeper, richer, more complicated, more compelling--and therefore worth the 50 percent to 200 percent premium they command over cheap mass products or even mainstream Bud. And yet, I've started to wonder, is this just costly snobbery? If I didn't know what I was drinking, could I even tell whether it was something from Belgium, vs. something from Pabst? 

         I'm afraid we'll never know the answer to that exact question, since I'm not brave enough to expose my own taste to a real test. But I'm brave enough to expose my friends'. This summer, while working at Microsoft, I put out a call for volunteers for a "science of beer" experiment. Testing candidates had to meet two criteria: 1) they had to like beer; and 2) they had to think they knew the difference between mass products and high-end microbrews. 

         Twelve tasters were selected, mainly on the basis of essays detailing their background with beer. A few were selected because they had been bosses in the Microsoft department where I worked. All were software managers or developers ; all were male, but I repeat myself. Nearly half had grown up outside the United States or lived abroad for enough years to speak haughtily about American macrobrews. Most tasters came in talking big about the refinement of their pal

Question:
How did the author feel about the various classifications of beer?

Options:
A: They thought microbreweries were just as likely to make all classes of beers since it have become so diversified
B: They felt a lot of microbreweries got into making lagers
C: They thought lagers would have more cheap brands included, whereas other classes not so much
D: They thought lagers were the worst of the beers

Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of
 love and lust

Question:
How much time has passed between Blake's night with Eldoria and his search for Sabrina York in his mind-world?

Passage:
Booze You Can Use 

         I love beer, but lately I've been wondering: Am I getting full value for my beer dollar? As I've stocked up on microbrews and fancy imports, I've told myself that their taste is deeper, richer, more complicated, more compelling--and therefore worth the 50 percent to 200 percent premium they command over cheap mass products or even mainstream Bud. And yet, I've started to wonder, is this just costly snobbery? If I didn't know what I was drinking, could I even tell whether it was something from Belgium, vs. something from Pabst? 

         I'm afraid we'll never know the answer to that exact question, since I'm not brave enough to expose my own taste to a real test. But I'm brave enough to expose my friends'. This summer, while working at Microsoft, I put out a call for volunteers for a "science of beer" experiment. Testing candidates had to meet two criteria: 1) they had to like beer; and 2) they had to think they knew the difference between mass products and high-end microbrews. 

         Twelve tasters were selected, mainly on the basis of essays detailing their background with beer. A few were selected because they had been bosses in the Microsoft department where I worked. All were software managers or developers ; all were male, but I repeat myself. Nearly half had grown up outside the United States or lived abroad for enough years to speak haughtily about American macrobrews. Most tasters came in talking big about the refinement of their pal

Options:

B: The results were too varied to really make a general conclusion
C: A low cost beer was actually ranked the best overall
D: Low cost beers actually rate pretty well when people don’t know what they’re drinking

C: Because Blake is acting like he's her father, which is a sensitive topic for Deirdre because she lost her real parents.

Passage:
Booze You Can Use 

         I love beer, but lately I've been wondering: Am I getting full value for my beer dollar? As I've stocked up on microbrews and fancy imports, I've told myself that their taste is deeper, richer, more complicated, more compelling--and therefore worth the 50 percent to 200 percent premium they command over cheap mass products or even mainstream Bud. And yet, I've started to wonder, is this just costly snobbery? If I didn't know what I was drinking, could I even tell whether it was something from Belgium, vs. something from Pabst? 

         I'm afraid we'll never know the answer to that exact question, since I'm not brave enough to expose my own taste to a real test. But I'm brave enough to expose my friends'. This summer, while working at Microsoft, I put out a call for volunteers for a "science of beer" experiment. Testing candidates had to meet two criteria: 1) they had to like beer; and 2) they had to think they knew the difference between mass products and high-end microbrews. 

         Twelve tasters were selected, mainly on the basis of essays detailing their background with beer. A few were selected because they had been bosses in the Microsoft department where I worked. All were software managers or developers ; all were male, but I repeat myself. Nearly half had grown up outside the United States or lived abroad for enough years to speak haughtily about American macrobrews. Most tasters came in talking big about the refinement of their pal

Question:
Why does Deirdre get so upset when Blake Past suggests she go to prom with the young man?

A: Because Blake is trying to guilt Deirdre into going with the young man by telling her that it'll ease her conscience. 
B: Because Deirdre has fallen in love with Blake, despite his age, and wants him to take her to the prom.  
C: Because Blake is acting like he's her father, which is a sensitive topic for Deirdre because she lost her real parents. 
D: Because the young man gave up his right arm in order to afford tickets to the prom, and this disgusts Deirdre.

### REAL QUESTION — ANSWER THIS ONLY ###
Passage:
Booze You Can Use 

         I love beer, but lately I've been wondering: Am I getting full value for my beer dollar? As I've stocked up on microbrews and fancy imports, I've told myself that their taste is deeper, richer, more complicated, more compelling--and therefore worth the 50 percent to 200 percent premium they command over cheap mass products or even mainstream Bud. And yet, I've started to wonder, is this just costly snobbery? If I didn't know what I was drinking, could I even tell whether it was something from Belgium, vs. something from Pabst? 

         I'm afraid we'll never know the answer to that exact question, since I'm not brave enough to expose my own taste to a real test. But I'm brave enough to expose my friends'. This summer, while working at Microsoft, I put out a call for volunteers for a "science of beer" experiment. Testing candidates had to meet two criteria: 1) they had to like beer; and 2) they had to think they knew the difference between mass products and high-end microbrews. 

         Twelve tasters were selected, mainly on the basis of essays detailing their background with beer. A few were selected because they had been bosses in the Microsoft department where I worked. All were software managers or developers ; all were male, but I repeat myself. Nearly half had grown up outside the United States or lived abroad for enough years to speak haughtily about American macrobrews. Most tasters came in talking big about the refinement of their pal

Question:
What is the general tone that the author writes in?

Options:
A: They are compassionate for the testers who are confused about how to run the experiment
B: They poke fun at the preferences of the participants based on their professions
C: They start off very confident about their own abilities, but learn by tasting that they actually aren’t any better than the rest of the testers
D: They take a serious, scientific approach because it’s mart of their market research profession

THE GIRL IN HIS MIND
By ROBERT F. YOUNG


 [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from

 Worlds of Tomorrow April 1963

 Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that

 the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]
Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of
 love and lust

Question:
How much time has passed between Blake's night with Eldoria and his search for Sabrina York in his mind-world?

A: 7 years
B: 10 hours

### REAL QUESTION — ANSWER THIS ONLY ###
Passage:
We Do Understand 

         "This is not another book about civility," Deborah Tannen promises in the first sentence of The Argument Culture . "Civility," she explains, suggests a "veneer of politeness spread thin over human relations like a layer of marmalade over toast." Instead, Tannen has written something less: a book about other books about civility. Quoting from Washington Post media critic Howard Kurtz, political scientist Larry Sabato, and others who have studied the rise of belligerence in politics, journalism, and law, Tannen spreads their insights thin over all human relations, painting a general theory of discord. The whole is less perceptive than its parts and more pernicious. 

         In her previous books-- That's Not What I Meant! (1986), You Just Don't Understand (1990), and Talking From 9 to 5 (1994)--Tannen carved out a niche as the nation's pre-eminent intergender translator and couples counselor. A professor of linguistics at Georgetown University, she transformed the comparative study of male and female conversational patterns from a linguistic subdiscipline into a self-help movement. Until recently, though, Tannen confined her analysis to conversations among dysfunctional individuals. (For an illustration, click .)

 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of
 love and lust

Question:
Why does Deirdre get so upset when Blake Past suggests she go to prom with the young man?

Options:
A: Because Blake is trying to guilt Deirdre into going with the young man by telling her that it'll ease her conscience. 
B: Because Deirdre has fallen in love with Blake, despite his age, and wants him to take her to the prom.  
C: Because Blake is acting like he's her father, which is a sensitive topic for Deirdre because she lost her real parents. 
D: Because the young man gave up his right arm in order to afford tickets to the prom, and this disgusts Deirdre.

### REAL QUESTION — ANSWER THIS ONLY ###
Passage:
We Do Understand 

         "This is not another book about civility," Deborah Tannen promises in the first sentence of The Argument Culture . "Civility," she explains, suggests a "veneer of politeness spread thin over human relations like a layer of marmalade over toast." Instead, Tannen has written something less: a book about other books about civility. Quoting from Washington Post media critic Howard Kurtz, political scientist Larry Sabato, and others who have studied the rise of belligerence in politics, journalism, and law, Tannen spreads their insights thin over all human relations, painting a general theory of discord. The whole is less perceptive than its parts and more pernicious. 

         In her previous books-- That's Not What I Meant! (1986), You Just Don't Understand (1990), and Talking From 9 to 5 (1994)--Tannen carved out a niche as the nation's pre-eminent intergender translator and couples counselor. A professor of linguistics at Georgetown University, she transformed the comparative study of male and female conversational patterns from a linguistic subdiscipline into a self-help movement. Until recently, though, Tannen confined her analysis to conversations among dysfunctional individuals. (For an illustration, click .) But in The Argument Culture , she takes her movement one step further, peddling the elixir of mutual understanding as a remedy for the whole damned dysfunctional country. This is necessary, she argues, because "contentious public discourse

Question:
What role does technology play in Tannen’s views?

Options:
A: It allows the facts to surface and be shared
B: It allows the public to communicate clearly and carefully with each other
C: It can spread misinformation, and enable ready critiquing of each other
D: It supports the first amendment of which there is no criticism

THE GIRL IN HIS MIND
By ROBERT F. YOUNG

Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of
 love and lust

Question:
How much time has passed between Blake's night with Eldoria and his search for Sabrina York in his mind-world?

Passage:

         "This is not another book about civility," Deborah Tannen promises in the first sentence of The Argument Culture . "Civility," she explains, suggests a "veneer of politeness spread thin over human relations like a layer of marmalade over toast." Instead, Tannen has written something less: a book about other books about civility. Quoting from Washington Post media critic Howard Kurtz, political scientist Larry Sabato, and others who have studied the rise of belligerence in politics, journalism, and law, Tannen spreads their insights thin over all human relations, painting a general theory of discord. The whole is less perceptive than its parts and more pernicious. 

         In her previous books-- That's Not What I Meant! (1986), You Just Don't Understand (1990), and Talking From 9 to 5 (1994)--Tannen carved out a niche as the nation's pre-eminent intergender translator and couples counselor.

### REAL QUESTION — ANSWER THIS ONLY ###
Passage:
We Do Understand 

         "This is not another book about civility," Deborah Tannen promises in the first sentence of The Argument Culture . "Civility," she explains, suggests a "veneer of politeness spread thin over human relations like a layer of marmalade over toast." Instead, Tannen has written something less: a book about other books about civility. Quoting from Washington Post media critic Howard Kurtz, political scientist Larry Sabato, and others who have studied the rise of belligerence in politics, journalism, and law, Tannen spreads their insights thin over all human relations, painting a general theory of discord. The whole is less perceptive than its parts and more pernicious. 

         In her previous books-- That's Not What I Meant! (1986), You Just Don't Understand (1990), and Talking From 9 to 5 (1994)--Tannen carved out a niche as the nation's pre-eminent intergender translator and couples counselor. A professor of linguistics at Georgetown University, she transformed the comparative study of male and female conversational patterns from a linguistic subdiscipline into a self-help movement. Until recently, though, Tannen confined her analysis to conversations among dysfunctional individuals. (For an illustration, click .) But in The Argument Culture , she takes her movement one step further, peddling the elixir of mutual understanding as a remedy for the whole damned dysfunctional country. This is necessary, she argues, because "contentious public discourse

Question:
Is there a nuance to the criticism of Tannen’s work?

Options:
A: The author recognizes some nuggets of good advice, but says they do not extend to the state of the nation
B: There is no recognition of any positive aspects of the work
C: The author agrees with many of the premises, but would choose to apply them differently
D: The author acknowledges the background that Tannen approaches the work from and balances the criticisms through that understanding

Passage:
THE GIRL IN HIS MIND
By ROBERT F. YOUNG


 [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from

 Worlds of Tomorrow April 1963

 Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that

 the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]
Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of
 love and lust

Question:
How much time has passed between Blake's night with Eldoria and his search for Sabrina York in his mind-world?

Options:
A: 7 years
B: 10 hours
C: 12 years
D: 1 hour

Question:
Why does Deirdre get so upset when Blake Past suggests she go to prom with the young man?

C: Because Blake is acting like he's her father, which is a sensitive topic for Deirdre because she lost her real parents.

### REAL QUESTION — ANSWER THIS ONLY ###
Passage:
We Do Understand 

         "This is not another book about civility," Deborah Tannen promises in the first sentence of The Argument Culture . "Civility," she explains, suggests a "veneer of politeness spread thin over human relations like a layer of marmalade over toast." Instead, Tannen has written something less: a book about other books about civility. Quoting from Washington Post media critic Howard Kurtz, political scientist Larry Sabato, and others who have studied the rise of belligerence in politics, journalism, and law, Tannen spreads their insights thin over all human relations, painting a general theory of discord. The whole is less perceptive than its parts and more pernicious. 

         In her previous books-- That's Not What I Meant! (1986), You Just Don't Understand (1990), and Talking From 9 to 5 (1994)--Tannen carved out a niche as the nation's pre-eminent intergender translator and couples counselor. A professor of linguistics at Georgetown University, she transformed the comparative study of male and female conversational patterns from a linguistic subdiscipline into a self-help movement. Until recently, though, Tannen confined her analysis to conversations among dysfunctional individuals. (For an illustration, click .) But in The Argument Culture , she takes her movement one step further, peddling the elixir of mutual understanding as a remedy for the whole damned dysfunctional country.

Question:

### REAL QUESTION — ANSWER THIS ONLY ###
Passage:
We Do Understand 

         "This is not another book about civility," Deborah Tannen promises in the first sentence of The Argument Culture . "Civility," she explains, suggests a "veneer of politeness spread thin over human relations like a layer of marmalade over toast." Instead, Tannen has written something less: a book about other books about civility. Quoting from Washington Post media critic Howard Kurtz, political scientist Larry Sabato, and others who have studied the rise of belligerence in politics, journalism, and law, Tannen spreads their insights thin over all human relations, painting a general theory of discord. The whole is less perceptive than its parts and more pernicious. 

         In her previous books-- That's Not What I Meant! (1986), You Just Don't Understand (1990), and Talking From 9 to 5 (1994)--Tannen carved out a niche as the nation's pre-eminent intergender translator and couples counselor. A professor of linguistics at Georgetown University, she transformed the comparative study of male and female conversational patterns from a linguistic subdiscipline into a self-help movement. Until recently, though, Tannen confined her analysis to conversations among dysfunctional individuals. (For an illustration, click .) But in The Argument Culture , she takes her movement one step further, peddling the elixir of mutual understanding as a remedy for the whole damned dysfunctional country. This is necessary, she argues, because "contentious public discourse

Question:
What do we know of the subjects that Tannen researches and writes about?

Options:
A: Primary interest in how humans argue, and how it might be done differently
B: Primary focus on international politics
C: Primary focus on journalism
D: Primary focus on the social aspects of war

THE GIRL IN HIS MIND
By ROBERT F. YOUNG


 [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from

 Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that

Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of
 love and lust

Passage:

         "This is not another book about civility," Deborah Tannen promises in the first sentence of The Argument Culture . "Civility," she explains, suggests a "veneer of politeness spread thin over human relations like a layer of marmalade over toast." Instead, Tannen has written something less: a book about other books about civility. Quoting from Washington Post media critic Howard Kurtz, political scientist Larry Sabato, and others who have studied the rise of belligerence in politics, journalism, and law, Tannen spreads their insights thin over all human relations, painting a general theory of discord. The whole is less perceptive than its parts and more pernicious. 

         In her previous books-- That's Not What I Meant! (1986), You Just Don't Understand (1990), and Talking From 9 to 5 (1994)--Tannen carved out a niche as the nation's pre-eminent intergender translator and couples counselor.

Until recently, though, Tannen confined her analysis to conversations among dysfunctional individuals. (For an illustration, click .)

Passage:
THE GIRL IN HIS MIND
By ROBERT F. YOUNG


 [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from

 Worlds of Tomorrow April 1963

 Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that

 the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]
Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of
 love and lust

Question:
How much time has passed between Blake's night with Eldoria and his search for Sabrina York in his mind-world?

Options:
A: 7 years
B: 10 hours
C: 12 years
D: 1 hour

### REAL QUESTION — ANSWER THIS ONLY ###
Passage:
We Do Understand 

         "This is not another book about civility," Deborah Tannen promises in the first sentence of The Argument Culture . "Civility," she explains, suggests a "veneer of politeness spread thin over human relations like a layer of marmalade over toast." Instead, Tannen has written something less: a book about other books about civility. Quoting from Washington Post media critic Howard Kurtz, political scientist Larry Sabato, and others who have studied the rise of belligerence in politics, journalism, and law, Tannen spreads their insights thin over all human relations, painting a general theory of discord. The whole is less perceptive than its parts and more pernicious. 

         In her previous books-- That's Not What I Meant! (1986), You Just Don't Understand (1990), and Talking From 9 to 5 (1994)--Tannen carved out a niche as the nation's pre-eminent intergender translator and couples counselor. A professor of linguistics at Georgetown University, she transformed the comparative study of male and female conversational patterns from a linguistic subdiscipline into a self-help movement. Until recently, though, Tannen confined her analysis to conversations among dysfunctional individuals. (For an illustration, click .) But in The Argument Culture , she takes her movement one step further, peddling the elixir of mutual understanding as a remedy for the whole damned dysfunctional country.

Question:
What is the significance of the author’s title for the piece?

Options:

C: They are remarking about Tannen’s ongoing feud with them
D: They use it as a jab against Tannen’s prior book title

Passage:
THE GIRL IN HIS MIND
By ROBERT F. YOUNG


 [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from

 Worlds of Tomorrow April 1963

 Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that

 the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]
Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of
 love and lust

Question:
How much time has passed between Blake's night with Eldoria and his search for Sabrina York in his mind-world?

Options:
A: 7 years
B: 10 hours
C: 12 years
D: 1 hour

The Man Who Was Six

 Illustrated by ASHMAN


 [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from

There is nothing at all like having a sound
 
mind in a sound body, but Dan Merrol had too
 
much of one—and also too much of the other!
"Sorry, darling," said Erica. She yawned, added, "I've tried—but I
 just can't believe you're my husband."


 He felt his own yawn slip off his face. "What do you mean? What am I
 doing here then?"


 "Can't you remember?" Her laughter tinkled as she pushed him away and
 sat up. "They said you were Dan Merrol at the hospital, but they must
 have been wrong."


 "Hospitals don't make that kind of mistake," he said with a certainty
 he didn't altogether feel.


 "But
I
should know, shouldn't I?"


 "Of course, but...." He did some verbal backstepping. "It was a
 bad accident. You've got to expect that I won't be quite the same
 at first." He sat up. "
Look
at me. Can't you tell who I am?" She
 returned his gaze, then swayed toward him. He decided that she was
 highly attractive—but surely he ought to have known that long ago.
With a visible effort she leaned away from him. "Your left eye does
 look familiar," she said cautiously. "The brown one, I mean."


 "The
brown
one?"


 "Your other eye's green," she told him.


 "Of course—a replacement. I told you it was a serious accident. 

Question:
Why was Erica unhappy when Dan was describing his six previous wives?

Options:
A: Because Dan remembered all of their names
B: Because she did not want to be the seventh wife
C: Because did not know that Dan was married before hand
D: Because Dan had not been married to these women

The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of
 love and lust

Question:
Why does shame flame in Blake's cheeks when Deirdre goes to prepare Eldoria's dias?

Options:
A: He is embarrassed at the thought that Deirdre might enter the room while he is sleeping with Eldoria. 
B: He feels that prostitution is morally reprehensible. 
C: He feels guilty about sleeping with Eldoria when there's a child in the hut, Deirdre, who knows exactly what's going on. 
D: He feels guilty about wishing Deirdre was older so he could sleep with her instead. 

Correct Answer: C

There is nothing at all like having a sound
 
mind in a sound body, but Dan Merrol had too
 
much of one—and also too much of the other!
"Sorry, darling," said Erica. She yawned, added, "I've tried—but I
 just can't believe you're my husband."


 He felt his own yawn slip off his face. "What do you mean? What am I
 doing here then?"


 "Can't you remember?" Her laughter tinkled as she pushed him away and
 sat up. "They said you were Dan Merrol at the hospital, but they must
 have been wrong."


 "Hospitals don't make that kind of mistake," he said with a certainty
 he didn't altogether feel.


 "But
I
should know, shouldn't I?"


 "Of course, but...." He did some verbal backstepping. "It was a
 bad accident. You've got to expect that I won't be quite the same
 at first." He sat up. "
Look
at me. Can't you tell who I am?" She
 returned his gaze, then swayed toward him. He decided that she was
 highly attractive—but surely he ought to have known that long ago.
With a visible effort she leaned away from him. "Your left eye does
 look familiar," she said cautiously. "The brown one, I mean."


 "The
brown
one?"


 "Your other eye's green," she told him.


 "Of course—a replacement. I told you it was a serious accident. 

Question:
Why did the doctors let Dan leave the hospital?

Options:
A: They did not, he left in secret
B: They were following Wysocki's theorem 
C: They ran out of space for patients because of the accident
D: They believed he was fully recovered

Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of
 love and lust

There is nothing at all like having a sound
 
mind in a sound body, but Dan Merrol had too
 
much of one—and also too much of the other!
"Sorry, darling," said Erica. She yawned, added, "I've tried—but I
 just can't believe you're my husband."


 He felt his own yawn slip off his face. "What do you mean? What am I
 doing here then?"


 "Can't you remember?" Her laughter tinkled as she pushed him away and
 sat up. "They said you were Dan Merrol at the hospital, but they must
 have been wrong."


 "Hospitals don't make that kind of mistake," he said with a certainty
 he didn't altogether feel.


 "But
I
should know, shouldn't I?"


 "Of course, but...." He did some verbal backstepping. "It was a
 bad accident. You've got to expect that I won't be quite the same
 at first." He sat up. "
Look
at me. Can't you tell who I am?" She
 returned his gaze, then swayed toward him. He decided that she was
 highly attractive—but surely he ought to have known that long ago.
With a visible effort she leaned away from him. "Your left eye does
 look familiar," she said cautiously. "The brown one, I mean."


 "The
brown
one?"


 "Your other eye's green," she told him.


 "Of course—a replacement. I told you it was a serious accident. 

Question:
Why did Dan believe that he was a lepidpoptera specialist? 

Options:
A: He received a partial brain transplant from a lepidopterist
B: He was repeating what the doctors from the hospital told him
C: He was mis-remembering a former career
D: He collected butterflies as a hobby

Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of
 love and lust

There is nothing at all like having a sound
 
mind in a sound body, but Dan Merrol had too
 
much of one—and also too much of the other!
"Sorry, darling," said Erica. She yawned, added, "I've tried—but I
 just can't believe you're my husband."


 He felt his own yawn slip off his face. "What do you mean? What am I
 doing here then?"


 "Can't you remember?" Her laughter tinkled as she pushed him away and
 sat up. "They said you were Dan Merrol at the hospital, but they must
 have been wrong."


 "Hospitals don't make that kind of mistake," he said with a certainty
 he didn't altogether feel.


 "But
I
should know, shouldn't I?"


 "Of course, but...." He did some verbal backstepping. "It was a
 bad accident. You've got to expect that I won't be quite the same
 at first." He sat up. "
Look
at me. Can't you tell who I am?" She
 returned his gaze, then swayed toward him. He decided that she was
 highly attractive—but surely he ought to have known that long ago.
With a visible effort she leaned away from him. "Your left eye does
 look familiar," she said cautiously. "The brown one, I mean."


 "The

 "Your other eye's green," she told him.


 "Of course—a replacement. I told you it was a serious accident.

THE GIRL IN HIS MIND
By ROBERT F. YOUNG


 [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from

 Worlds of Tomorrow April 1963

 Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that

Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of
 love and lust

There is nothing at all like having a sound
 
mind in a sound body, but Dan Merrol had too
 
much of one—and also too much of the other!
"Sorry, darling," said Erica. She yawned, added, "I've tried—but I
 just can't believe you're my husband."


 He felt his own yawn slip off his face. "What do you mean? What am I
 doing here then?"


 "Can't you remember?" Her laughter tinkled as she pushed him away and
 sat up. "They said you were Dan Merrol at the hospital, but they must
 have been wrong."


 "Hospitals don't make that kind of mistake," he said with a certainty
 he didn't altogether feel.


 "But
I
should know, shouldn't I?"


 "Of course, but...." He did some verbal backstepping. "It was a
 bad accident. You've got to expect that I won't be quite the same
 at first." He sat up. "
Look
at me. Can't you tell who I am?" She
 returned his gaze, then swayed toward him. He decided that she was
 highly attractive—but surely he ought to have known that long ago.
With a visible effort she leaned away from him. "Your left eye does
 look familiar," she said cautiously. "The brown one, I mean."


 "The
brown
one?"


 "Your other eye's green," she told him.


 "Of course—a replacement. I told you it was a serious accident.

Passage:
THE GIRL IN HIS MIND
By ROBERT F. YOUNG


 [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from

 Worlds of Tomorrow April 1963

 Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that

 the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]
Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of
 love and lust

Question:
How much time has passed between Blake's night with Eldoria and his search for Sabrina York in his mind-world?

Options:
A: 7 years
B: 10 hours
C: 12 years
D: 1 hour

Question:
Why does Deirdre get so upset when Blake Past suggests she go to prom with the young man?

A: Because Blake is trying to guilt Deirdre into going with the young man by telling her that it'll ease her conscience. 
B: Because Deirdre has fallen in love with Blake, despite his age, and wants him to take her to the prom.  
C: Because Blake is acting like he's her father, which is a sensitive topic for Deirdre because she lost her real parents.

There is nothing at all like having a sound
 
mind in a sound body, but Dan Merrol had too
 
much of one—and also too much of the other!
"Sorry, darling," said Erica. She yawned, added, "I've tried—but I
 just can't believe you're my husband."


 He felt his own yawn slip off his face. "What do you mean? What am I
 doing here then?"


 "Can't you remember?" Her laughter tinkled as she pushed him away and
 sat up. "They said you were Dan Merrol at the hospital, but they must
 have been wrong."


 "Hospitals don't make that kind of mistake," he said with a certainty
 he didn't altogether feel.


 "But
I
should know, shouldn't I?"


 "Of course, but...." He did some verbal backstepping. "It was a
 bad accident. You've got to expect that I won't be quite the same
 at first." He sat up. "
Look
at me. Can't you tell who I am?" She
 returned his gaze, then swayed toward him. He decided that she was
 highly attractive—but surely he ought to have known that long ago.
With a visible effort she leaned away from him. "Your left eye does
 look familiar," she said cautiously. "The brown one, I mean."


 "The
brown
one?"


 "Your other eye's green," she told him.


 "Of course—a replacement. I told you it was a serious accident. 

Question:
Why did the receptionist at the hospital laugh at the Dan?

Options:
A: His physical appearance was comical
B: His request to see the Dr. without an appointment was absurd
C: He clumsily brushed her on the shoulder.
D: She was surprised to see that he had returned

THE GIRL IN HIS MIND
By ROBERT F. YOUNG


 [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from

 Worlds of Tomorrow April 1963

 Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that

 the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]
Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of
 love and lust

Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of
 love and lust

Question:
Why does Deirdre get so upset when Blake Past suggests she go to prom with the young man?

Options:
A: Because Blake is trying to guilt Deirdre into going with the young man by telling her that it'll ease her conscience. 
B: Because Deirdre has fallen in love with Blake, despite his age, and wants him to take her to the prom.  
C: Because Blake is acting like he's her father, which is a sensitive topic for Deirdre because she lost her real parents. 
D: Because the young man gave up his right arm in order to afford tickets to the prom, and this disgusts Deirdre.

There is nothing at all like having a sound
 
mind in a sound body, but Dan Merrol had too
 
much of one—and also too much of the other!
"Sorry, darling," said Erica. She yawned, added, "I've tried—but I
 just can't believe you're my husband."


 He felt his own yawn slip off his face. "What do you mean? What am I
 doing here then?"


 "Can't you remember?" Her laughter tinkled as she pushed him away and
 sat up. "They said you were Dan Merrol at the hospital, but they must
 have been wrong."


 "Hospitals don't make that kind of mistake," he said with a certainty
 he didn't altogether feel.


 "But
I
should know, shouldn't I?"


 "Of course, but...." He did some verbal backstepping. "It was a
 bad accident. You've got to expect that I won't be quite the same
 at first." He sat up. "
Look
at me. Can't you tell who I am?" She
 returned his gaze, then swayed toward him. He decided that she was
 highly attractive—but surely he ought to have known that long ago.
With a visible effort she leaned away from him. "Your left eye does
 look familiar," she said cautiously. "The brown one, I mean."


 "The
brown
one?"


 "Your other eye's green," she told him.


 "Of course—a replacement. I told you it was a serious accident. 

Question:
Why was Dr. Crander so proud of his work on the patient?

Options:
A: They were able to rehabilitate Dan much more quickly than expected. 
B: No one had ever spent that extreme amount of time in a regeneration tank before
C: They thought the patient would never walk or talk again. 
D: Overcoming the complexities involved in matching donor body parts.

 Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that

Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7

 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of

Passage:
THE GIRL IN HIS MIND
By ROBERT F. YOUNG


 [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from

 Worlds of Tomorrow April 1963

 Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that

 the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]
Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of
 love and lust

Question:
How much time has passed between Blake's night with Eldoria and his search for Sabrina York in his mind-world?

Options:
A: 7 years
B: 10 hours
C: 12 years
D: 1 hour

Question:
Why does Deirdre get so upset when Blake Past suggests she go to prom with the young man?

Options:
A: Because Blake is trying to guilt Deirdre into going with the young man by telling her that it'll ease her conscience. 
B: Because Deirdre has fallen in love with Blake, despite his age, and wants him to take her to the prom.  
C: Because Blake is acting like he's her father, which is a sensitive topic for Deirdre because she lost her real parents. 
D: Because the young man gave up his right arm in order to afford tickets to the prom, and this disgusts Deirdre.

Passage:
THE GIRL IN HIS MIND
By ROBERT F. YOUNG

Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of
 love and lust

Question:
Why does shame flame in Blake's cheeks when Deirdre goes to prepare Eldoria's dias?

Options:
A: He is embarrassed at the thought that Deirdre might enter the room while he is sleeping with Eldoria. 
B: He feels that prostitution is morally reprehensible. 
C: He feels guilty about sleeping with Eldoria when there's a child in the hut, Deirdre, who knows exactly what's going on. 
D: He feels guilty about wishing Deirdre was older so he could sleep with her instead. 

Correct Answer: C

Passage:
Dark Side Lite 

         Those poor souls who've been camping out in front of theaters for six weeks: Who can blame them for saying, "To hell with the critics, we know it will be great!"? The doors will open, and they'll race to grab the best seats and feel a surge of triumph as their butts sink down. We've made it: Yeeehaww!! They'll cheer when the familiar John Williams fanfare erupts and the title-- Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace --rises out of the screen and the backward-slanted opening "crawl" begins: "A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away ..." Yaaahhhhhhh!!! Then, their hearts pounding, they'll settle back to read the rest of the titles: "Turmoil has engulfed the Galactic Republic. The taxation of trade routes to outlying star systems is in dispute." Taxation of trade routes: Waaahoooo!!!!              

         How long will they go with it? At what point will they realize that what they've heard is, alas, true, that the picture really is a stiff? Maybe they never will. Maybe they'll want to love The 

            Phantom Menace so much--because they have so much emotional energy invested in loving it, and in buying the books, magazines, dolls, cards, clothes, soap, fast food, etc.--that the realization will never sink in. In successful hypnosis, the subject works to enter a state of heightened susceptibility, to surrender to a higher power. Maybe they'll conclude that common sense is the enemy of the Force and fight it to the death.

Question:
How does the author feel about the Phantom Menace's implications on the timeline of Star Wars as a whole?

Options:
A: He is upset by the time wasted divulging useless backstory and information

C: He feels that it lacks effort for under explaining certain aspects
D: He likes that the original details of the trilogy has been preserved

THE GIRL IN HIS MIND
By ROBERT F. YOUNG


 [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from

 Worlds of Tomorrow April 1963

 Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that

 the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]
Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of
 love and lust

Question:
How much time has passed between Blake's night with Eldoria and his search for Sabrina York in his mind-world?

Options:
A: 7 years
B: 10 hours
C: 12 years
D: 1 hour

All this can be fixed, of course, with 10 grand of straightening, filling, sealing, and whitening.

Second, be grateful that you have avoided the "intra-oral camera." As the dentist (or assistant) navigates this horrifying little gadget through the graveyard of your mouth, a color television magnifies the florid pustulance of your gums and the puke-yellow dinge of your smile. A harmless crevice in your silver-mercury amalgam filling looks like Hell's Canyon. The microcracks in your enamel look like a broken window. All this can be fixed, of course, with 10 grand of straightening, filling, sealing, and whitening. "You will agree to anything the second they put that thing in your mouth," says one recent victim of the camera. "You can't believe you are walking around with that, that, that ick in your mouth."

Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of
 love and lust

Question:
How much time has passed between Blake's night with Eldoria and his search for Sabrina York in his mind-world?

A: 7 years
B: 10 hours

Why does Deirdre get so upset when Blake Past suggests she go to prom with the young man?

### REAL QUESTION — ANSWER THIS ONLY ###
Passage:
Defining Decay Down 

         If you haven't visited a dentist in the past few years, first of all, that's gross. (Checkups are every six months, and don't pretend you forgot.) Second, be grateful that you have avoided the "intra-oral camera." As the dentist (or assistant) navigates this horrifying little gadget through the graveyard of your mouth, a color television magnifies the florid pustulance of your gums and the puke-yellow dinge of your smile. A harmless crevice in your silver-mercury amalgam filling looks like Hell's Canyon. The microcracks in your enamel look like a broken window. All this can be fixed, of course, with 10 grand of straightening, filling, sealing, and whitening. "You will agree to anything the second they put that thing in your mouth," says one recent victim of the camera. "You can't believe you are walking around with that, that, that ick in your mouth." 

         The transformation of American dentistry from drill-and-fill to shoot-and-loot is an unlikely business success story of the '90s, a case study in how a profession can work itself out of a job and still prosper. Dentists, after all, are supposed to be extinct by now. While they happily (and profitably) scraped teeth and filled cavities during the '60s and '70s, fluoride was quietly choking off their revenue stream. The percentage of children with cavities fell by half and kept falling. People stopped going to the dentist, because they didn't need to. At the same time, the government funde

How do dentists sell unnecessary cosmetic procedures to their patients?

Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."

Question:
Why does Deirdre get so upset when Blake Past suggests she go to prom with the young man?

Options:
A: Because Blake is trying to guilt Deirdre into going with the young man by telling her that it'll ease her conscience. 
B: Because Deirdre has fallen in love with Blake, despite his age, and wants him to take her to the prom.  
C: Because Blake is acting like he's her father, which is a sensitive topic for Deirdre because she lost her real parents. 
D: Because the young man gave up his right arm in order to afford tickets to the prom, and this disgusts Deirdre.

### REAL QUESTION — ANSWER THIS ONLY ###
Passage:
Defining Decay Down 

         If you haven't visited a dentist in the past few years, first of all, that's gross. (Checkups are every six months, and don't pretend you forgot.) Second, be grateful that you have avoided the "intra-oral camera." As the dentist (or assistant) navigates this horrifying little gadget through the graveyard of your mouth, a color television magnifies the florid pustulance of your gums and the puke-yellow dinge of your smile. A harmless crevice in your silver-mercury amalgam filling looks like Hell's Canyon. The microcracks in your enamel look like a broken window. All this can be fixed, of course, with 10 grand of straightening, filling, sealing, and whitening. "You will agree to anything the second they put that thing in your mouth," says one recent victim of the camera. "You can't believe you are walking around with that, that, that ick in your mouth." 

         The transformation of American dentistry from drill-and-fill to shoot-and-loot is an unlikely business success story of the '90s, a case study in how a profession can work itself out of a job and still prosper. Dentists, after all, are supposed to be extinct by now. While they happily (and profitably) scraped teeth and filled cavities during the '60s and '70s, fluoride was quietly choking off their revenue stream. The percentage of children with cavities fell by half and kept falling. People stopped going to the dentist, because they didn't need to. At the same time, the government funde

Question:
What is the author's overall feeling towards modern dentistry as a whole in this passage?

Options:
A: Apathetic; the author reports the developments in the dental industry in an unbiased manor
B: Negative; the author believes that all of the advancements of modern dentistry are an unnecessary scam 
C: Positive; the author implies that modern dentistry has only improved the dental hygiene of the public
D: Mixed; the author acknowledges both positives and negative aspects of modern dentistry

Let the dead past bury its dead?
 
Not while I am alive, it won't!
It surely was all right for me to let myself do it now. I couldn't have
 been more safe. In the window of the radio store a color television
 set was enjoying a quiz by itself and creased in my pocket was the
 newspaper account of the failure of a monumental human adventure in the
 blooming extinction of a huge rocket. The boys on the corner seemed
 hardly human, scowling anthropoids in walrus-skin coats. It was my own
 time. Anybody could see I was safe, and I could risk doing what I ached
 to do.


 I turned the corner.


 The breaks were against me from the start. It didn't come as any
 surprise. I could never get away with it. I knew that all along.


 There was a Packard parked just beyond the fire plug.


 The metal and glass fronts of the buildings didn't show back here, only
 seasoned brick glued with powdering chalk. The line of the block seemed

 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."

It surely was all right for me to let myself do it now. I couldn't have

 set was enjoying a quiz by itself and creased in my pocket was the

 I turned the corner.


 The breaks were against me from the start. It didn't come as any
 surprise. I could never get away with it. I knew that all along.


 There was a Packard parked just beyond the fire plug.


 The metal and glass fronts of the buildings didn't show back here, only

Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of
 love and lust

Let the dead past bury its dead?
 
Not while I am alive, it won't!
It surely was all right for me to let myself do it now. I couldn't have
 been more safe. In the window of the radio store a color television
 set was enjoying a quiz by itself and creased in my pocket was the
 newspaper account of the failure of a monumental human adventure in the
 blooming extinction of a huge rocket. The boys on the corner seemed
 hardly human, scowling anthropoids in walrus-skin coats. It was my own
 time. Anybody could see I was safe, and I could risk doing what I ached
 to do.


 I turned the corner.


 The breaks were against me from the start. It didn't come as any
 surprise. I could never get away with it. I knew that all along.


 There was a Packard parked just beyond the fire plug.


 The metal and glass fronts of the buildings didn't show back here, only
 seasoned brick glued with powdering chalk. The line of the block seemed
 to stretch back, ever further away from the glossy fronts into the

 A man brushed past me, wearing an Ivy League suit and snap-brim hat,

 I decided to chance it. I certainly wanted to do it in the worst way.

Passage:
THE GIRL IN HIS MIND
By ROBERT F. YOUNG


 [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from

 Worlds of Tomorrow April 1963

 Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that

 the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]
Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of
 love and lust

Question:
How much time has passed between Blake's night with Eldoria and his search for Sabrina York in his mind-world?

Options:
A: 7 years
B: 10 hours
C: 12 years

THE AIR OF CASTOR OIL
BY JIM HARMON


 Illustrated by WALKER


 [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from

 Galaxy Magazine August 1961.

 Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that

Let the dead past bury its dead?
 
Not while I am alive, it won't!
It surely was all right for me to let myself do it now. I couldn't have
 been more safe. In the window of the radio store a color television
 set was enjoying a quiz by itself and creased in my pocket was the
 newspaper account of the failure of a monumental human adventure in the
 blooming extinction of a huge rocket. The boys on the corner seemed
 hardly human, scowling anthropoids in walrus-skin coats. It was my own
 time. Anybody could see I was safe, and I could risk doing what I ached
 to do.


 I turned the corner.


 The breaks were against me from the start. It didn't come as any
 surprise. I could never get away with it. I knew that all along.


 There was a Packard parked just beyond the fire plug.


 The metal and glass fronts of the buildings didn't show back here, only
 seasoned brick glued with powdering chalk. The line of the block seemed
 to stretch back, ever further away from the glossy fronts into the
 crumbling stone.


 A man brushed past me, wearing an Ivy League suit and snap-brim hat,
 carrying a briefcase. And, reassuringly, he was in a hurry.


 I decided to chance it. I certainly wanted to do it in the worst way.

Question:

Passage:
THE GIRL IN HIS MIND
By ROBERT F. YOUNG


 [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from

 Worlds of Tomorrow April 1963

 Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that

 the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]
Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of
 love and lust

Question:
How much time has passed between Blake's night with Eldoria and his search for Sabrina York in his mind-world?

Options:
A: 7 years
B: 10 hours
C: 12 years
D: 1 hour

Correct Answer: B

C: Because Blake is acting like he's her father, which is a sensitive topic for Deirdre because she lost her real parents.

Let the dead past bury its dead?
 
Not while I am alive, it won't!
It surely was all right for me to let myself do it now. I couldn't have
 been more safe. In the window of the radio store a color television
 set was enjoying a quiz by itself and creased in my pocket was the
 newspaper account of the failure of a monumental human adventure in the
 blooming extinction of a huge rocket. The boys on the corner seemed
 hardly human, scowling anthropoids in walrus-skin coats. It was my own
 time. Anybody could see I was safe, and I could risk doing what I ached
 to do.


 I turned the corner.


 The breaks were against me from the start. It didn't come as any
 surprise. I could never get away with it. I knew that all along.


 There was a Packard parked just beyond the fire plug.


 The metal and glass fronts of the buildings didn't show back here, only
 seasoned brick glued with powdering chalk. The line of the block seemed
 to stretch back, ever further away from the glossy fronts into the
 crumbling stone.


 A man brushed past me, wearing an Ivy League suit and snap-brim hat,
 carrying a briefcase. And, reassuringly, he was in a hurry.


 I decided to chance it. I certainly wanted to do it in the worst way.

Question:

Passage:
THE GIRL IN HIS MIND
By ROBERT F. YOUNG


 [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from

 Worlds of Tomorrow April 1963

 Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that

 the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]
Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of
 love and lust

Question:
How much time has passed between Blake's night with Eldoria and his search for Sabrina York in his mind-world?

Options:
A: 7 years
B: 10 hours
C: 12 years

Let the dead past bury its dead?
 
Not while I am alive, it won't!
It surely was all right for me to let myself do it now. I couldn't have
 been more safe. In the window of the radio store a color television
 set was enjoying a quiz by itself and creased in my pocket was the
 newspaper account of the failure of a monumental human adventure in the
 blooming extinction of a huge rocket. The boys on the corner seemed
 hardly human, scowling anthropoids in walrus-skin coats. It was my own
 time. Anybody could see I was safe, and I could risk doing what I ached
 to do.


 I turned the corner.


 The breaks were against me from the start. It didn't come as any
 surprise. I could never get away with it. I knew that all along.


 There was a Packard parked just beyond the fire plug.


 The metal and glass fronts of the buildings didn't show back here, only
 seasoned brick glued with powdering chalk. The line of the block seemed
 to stretch back, ever further away from the glossy fronts into the
 crumbling stone.


 A man brushed past me, wearing an Ivy League suit and snap-brim hat,
 carrying a briefcase. And, reassuringly, he was in a hurry.


 I decided to chance it. I certainly wanted to do it in the worst way.

Passage:
THE GIRL IN HIS MIND
By ROBERT F. YOUNG


 [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from

 Worlds of Tomorrow April 1963

 Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that

 the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]
Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of
 love and lust

Question:
How much time has passed between Blake's night with Eldoria and his search for Sabrina York in his mind-world?

Options:
A: 7 years
B: 10 hours

THE AIR OF CASTOR OIL

 Galaxy Magazine August 1961.

Let the dead past bury its dead?
 
Not while I am alive, it won't!
It surely was all right for me to let myself do it now. I couldn't have
 been more safe. In the window of the radio store a color television
 set was enjoying a quiz by itself and creased in my pocket was the
 newspaper account of the failure of a monumental human adventure in the
 blooming extinction of a huge rocket. The boys on the corner seemed
 hardly human, scowling anthropoids in walrus-skin coats. It was my own
 time. Anybody could see I was safe, and I could risk doing what I ached
 to do.


 I turned the corner.


 The breaks were against me from the start. It didn't come as any
 surprise. I could never get away with it. I knew that all along.


 There was a Packard parked just beyond the fire plug.


 The metal and glass fronts of the buildings didn't show back here, only
 seasoned brick glued with powdering chalk. The line of the block seemed
 to stretch back, ever further away from the glossy fronts into the
 crumbling stone.


 A man brushed past me, wearing an Ivy League suit and snap-brim hat,
 carrying a briefcase. And, reassuringly, he was in a hurry.


 I decided to chance it. I certainly wanted to do it in the worst way.

Passage:
THE GIRL IN HIS MIND
By ROBERT F. YOUNG


 [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from

 Worlds of Tomorrow April 1963

 Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that

 the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]
Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of
 love and lust

Question:
How much time has passed between Blake's night with Eldoria and his search for Sabrina York in his mind-world?

A: 7 years
B: 10 hours

C: Because Blake is acting like he's her father, which is a sensitive topic for Deirdre because she lost her real parents.

It surely was all right for me to let myself do it now. I couldn't have
 been more safe. In the window of the radio store a color television
 set was enjoying a quiz by itself and creased in my pocket was the
 newspaper account of the failure of a monumental human adventure in the
 blooming extinction of a huge rocket. The boys on the corner seemed
 hardly human, scowling anthropoids in walrus-skin coats. It was my own
 time. Anybody could see I was safe, and I could risk doing what I ached
 to do.


 I turned the corner.


 The breaks were against me from the start. It didn't come as any

 There was a Packard parked just beyond the fire plug.


 The metal and glass fronts of the buildings didn't show back here, only
 seasoned brick glued with powdering chalk. The line of the block seemed
 to stretch back, ever further away from the glossy fronts into the

 A man brushed past me, wearing an Ivy League suit and snap-brim hat,

But after flailing away in my living room for a few nights, my interest was piqued, and I decided to find out more about the real thing. Which martial art teaches good self-defense tactics?

All ratings are on a scale of one to five, with five being the hardest, most intimidating, or most valuable. \\n\\n         To experts, this will look like a hopelessly biased and superficial inquiry.

Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."

Question:
Why does shame flame in Blake's cheeks when Deirdre goes to prepare Eldoria's dias?

Options:
A: He is embarrassed at the thought that Deirdre might enter the room while he is sleeping with Eldoria. 
B: He feels that prostitution is morally reprehensible. 
C: He feels guilty about sleeping with Eldoria when there's a child in the hut, Deirdre, who knows exactly what's going on. 
D: He feels guilty about wishing Deirdre was older so he could sleep with her instead.

### REAL QUESTION — ANSWER THIS ONLY ###
Passage:
Kick Me 

         Not long ago, out of curiosity, I picked up some exercise videos by Billy Blanks, the king of Tae-Bo. What a flop. The sets were cheesy, the music was awful 1980s synth-pop, and despite their martial-arts pretensions, the routines felt more like aerobics in disguise than like kung fu. But after flailing away in my living room for a few nights, my interest was piqued, and I decided to find out more about the real thing. Which martial art teaches good self-defense tactics? Which one would give me a good aerobic workout? How daunting would it be to jump into a class as a complete beginner? And would I get pummeled by the other students? 

         To find out, I tried a handful of karate, tae kwon do, aikido, jujitsu, and kung fu classes in the Seattle area. I scored each one in several areas: how intimidating the class would be to a novice; how much the exercises worked my muscles; how much of an I got; whether it would develop coordination and balance; how much physical contact with other people was involved; and, of course, its value in self-defense. All ratings are on a scale of one to five, with five being the hardest, most intimidating, or most valuable. 

         To experts, this will look like a hopelessly biased and superficial inquiry. It is. But to beginners, it is one step toward figuring out which martial art might be right for you. Do you want a chance to kick the stuffing out of someone? Take tae kwon do. Do you want to improve your sense of ba

Question:
What was the author's initial motivation for writing the comparison list?

Options:
A: She wanted to gain more balance and coordination
B: She wanted to get stronger
C: Wanting to find a better over all martial art than Tae-Bo
D: She wanted to get into better aerobic shape

THE GIRL IN HIS MIND
By ROBERT F. YOUNG


 [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from

 Worlds of Tomorrow April 1963

 Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that

 the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]
Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of
 love and lust

Question:
How much time has passed between Blake's night with Eldoria and his search for Sabrina York in his mind-world?

THE GIRL IN HIS MIND
By ROBERT F. YOUNG


 [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from

 Worlds of Tomorrow April 1963

 Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that

 the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]
Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of
 love and lust

Passage:
THE GIRL IN HIS MIND
By ROBERT F. YOUNG


 [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from

 Worlds of Tomorrow April 1963

 Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that

 the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]
Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of
 love and lust

Question:
How much time has passed between Blake's night with Eldoria and his search for Sabrina York in his mind-world?

Options:
A: 7 years
B: 10 hours
C: 12 years
D: 1 hour

Question:
Why does Deirdre get so upset when Blake Past suggests she go to prom with the young man?

Options:
A: Because Blake is trying to guilt Deirdre into going with the young man by telling her that it'll ease her conscience. 
B: Because Deirdre has fallen in love with Blake, despite his age, and wants him to take her to the prom.  
C: Because Blake is acting like he's her father, which is a sensitive topic for Deirdre because she lost her real parents. 
D: Because the young man gave up his right arm in order to afford tickets to the prom, and this disgusts Deirdre.

Passage:
Kick Me 

         Not long ago, out of curiosity, I picked up some exercise videos by Billy Blanks, the king of Tae-Bo. What a flop. The sets were cheesy, the music was awful 1980s synth-pop, and despite their martial-arts pretensions, the routines felt more like aerobics in disguise than like kung fu. But after flailing away in my living room for a few nights, my interest was piqued, and I decided to find out more about the real thing. Which martial art teaches good self-defense tactics? Which one would give me a good aerobic workout? How daunting would it be to jump into a class as a complete beginner? And would I get pummeled by the other students? 

         To find out, I tried a handful of karate, tae kwon do, aikido, jujitsu, and kung fu classes in the Seattle area. I scored each one in several areas: how intimidating the class would be to a novice; how much the exercises worked my muscles; how much of an I got; whether it would develop coordination and balance; how much physical contact with other people was involved; and, of course, its value in self-defense. All ratings are on a scale of one to five, with five being the hardest, most intimidating, or most valuable. 

         To experts, this will look like a hopelessly biased and superficial inquiry. It is. But to beginners, it is one step toward figuring out which martial art might be right for you.

### REAL QUESTION — ANSWER THIS ONLY ###
Passage:
Kick Me 

         Not long ago, out of curiosity, I picked up some exercise videos by Billy Blanks, the king of Tae-Bo. What a flop. The sets were cheesy, the music was awful 1980s synth-pop, and despite their martial-arts pretensions, the routines felt more like aerobics in disguise than like kung fu. But after flailing away in my living room for a few nights, my interest was piqued, and I decided to find out more about the real thing. Which martial art teaches good self-defense tactics? Which one would give me a good aerobic workout? How daunting would it be to jump into a class as a complete beginner? And would I get pummeled by the other students? 

         To find out, I tried a handful of karate, tae kwon do, aikido, jujitsu, and kung fu classes in the Seattle area. I scored each one in several areas: how intimidating the class would be to a novice; how much the exercises worked my muscles; how much of an I got; whether it would develop coordination and balance; how much physical contact with other people was involved; and, of course, its value in self-defense. All ratings are on a scale of one to five, with five being the hardest, most intimidating, or most valuable. 

         To experts, this will look like a hopelessly biased and superficial inquiry. It is. But to beginners, it is one step toward figuring out which martial art might be right for you. Do you want a chance to kick the stuffing out of someone? Take tae kwon do. Do you want to improve your sense of ba

Question:
How did the author choose to score each martial art for "intimidation?"

Options:
A: By how sore she was after each class
B: By how often the participants in the class were hurt
C: By how large the participants in the class were
D: By how welcoming the class was

THE GIRL IN HIS MIND
By ROBERT F. YOUNG


 [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from

 Worlds of Tomorrow April 1963

 Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that

 the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]
Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of
 love and lust

Question:
How much time has passed between Blake's night with Eldoria and his search for Sabrina York in his mind-world?

A: 7 years
B: 10 hours

THE GIRL IN HIS MIND
By ROBERT F. YOUNG


 [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from

 Worlds of Tomorrow April 1963

 Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that

 the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]
Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of
 love and lust

Passage:
THE GIRL IN HIS MIND
By ROBERT F. YOUNG


 [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from

 Worlds of Tomorrow April 1963

 Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that

 the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]
Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of
 love and lust

Question:
How much time has passed between Blake's night with Eldoria and his search for Sabrina York in his mind-world?

Options:
A: 7 years
B: 10 hours
C: 12 years
D: 1 hour

Question:
Why does Deirdre get so upset when Blake Past suggests she go to prom with the young man?

Options:
A: Because Blake is trying to guilt Deirdre into going with the young man by telling her that it'll ease her conscience. 
B: Because Deirdre has fallen in love with Blake, despite his age, and wants him to take her to the prom.  
C: Because Blake is acting like he's her father, which is a sensitive topic for Deirdre because she lost her real parents. 
D: Because the young man gave up his right arm in order to afford tickets to the prom, and this disgusts Deirdre.

### REAL QUESTION — ANSWER THIS ONLY ###
Passage:
Kick Me 

         Not long ago, out of curiosity, I picked up some exercise videos by Billy Blanks, the king of Tae-Bo. What a flop. The sets were cheesy, the music was awful 1980s synth-pop, and despite their martial-arts pretensions, the routines felt more like aerobics in disguise than like kung fu. But after flailing away in my living room for a few nights, my interest was piqued, and I decided to find out more about the real thing. Which martial art teaches good self-defense tactics? Which one would give me a good aerobic workout? How daunting would it be to jump into a class as a complete beginner? And would I get pummeled by the other students? 

         To find out, I tried a handful of karate, tae kwon do, aikido, jujitsu, and kung fu classes in the Seattle area. I scored each one in several areas: how intimidating the class would be to a novice; how much the exercises worked my muscles; how much of an I got; whether it would develop coordination and balance; how much physical contact with other people was involved; and, of course, its value in self-defense. All ratings are on a scale of one to five, with five being the hardest, most intimidating, or most valuable. 

         To experts, this will look like a hopelessly biased and superficial inquiry. It is. But to beginners, it is one step toward figuring out which martial art might be right for you. Do you want a chance to kick the stuffing out of someone? Take tae kwon do. Do you want to improve your sense of ba

Question:
Why does the author think that Akido could explain why Steven Seagal is not in good shape?

Options:
A: It does not need to be practiced often
B: It is not a good self-defense martial art
C: There is little aerobic exercise involved
D: It is a non-aggressive martial art

### REAL QUESTION — ANSWER THIS ONLY ###
Passage:
I, Antichrist? 

         Early one shiny autumn morning, I got in my car and drove to Lynchburg, Va., in order to find out whether or not I am the Antichrist. You know: the Beast, the Worthless Shepherd, the Little Horn, the Abomination, the linchpin of the Diabolical Trinity. That Antichrist. 

         I had my suspicions. Nowhere on my body could I find the mark of the Beast--666--but I do have a freckle that's shaped like Bermuda. And though I have never been seized by a desire to lead the armies of Satan in a final, bloody confrontation with the forces of God on the plain of Armageddon, I do suffer from aggravated dyspepsia, as well as chronic malaise, conditions that I'm sure afflict the Antichrist. 

         The surest suspicion I had about my pivotal role in Christian eschatology grew from the fact that I am Jewish, male, and alive. These are the qualifications for the job of Antichrist as specified by Lynchburg's most famous preacher, Jerry Falwell, in a speech he made earlier this year. 

         I was actually going to see the Rev. Falwell on a different matter, the future of Jerusalem, but I thought I might just slip this question--the one about me maybe being the Antichrist--into the stream of the interview. Falwell, I guessed, wouldn't be happy to discuss his views on the identity of the Antichrist--he had apologized for the remark but took quite a load of grief for it anyway. 

         As it turned out, though, Falwell was eager to talk about the Antichrist

Question:
Why does the author believe he might be the Antichrist?

Options:
A: He has a strangely shaped mole on his body
B: He was told so by a famous evangelical preacher
C: It is a satirical response to the evangelical myth
D: Each of his names has six letters

### REAL QUESTION — ANSWER THIS ONLY ###
Passage:
I, Antichrist? 

         Early one shiny autumn morning, I got in my car and drove to Lynchburg, Va., in order to find out whether or not I am the Antichrist. You know: the Beast, the Worthless Shepherd, the Little Horn, the Abomination, the linchpin of the Diabolical Trinity. That Antichrist. 

         I had my suspicions. Nowhere on my body could I find the mark of the Beast--666--but I do have a freckle that's shaped like Bermuda. And though I have never been seized by a desire to lead the armies of Satan in a final, bloody confrontation with the forces of God on the plain of Armageddon, I do suffer from aggravated dyspepsia, as well as chronic malaise, conditions that I'm sure afflict the Antichrist. 

         The surest suspicion I had about my pivotal role in Christian eschatology grew from the fact that I am Jewish, male, and alive. These are the qualifications for the job of Antichrist as specified by Lynchburg's most famous preacher, Jerry Falwell, in a speech he made earlier this year. 

         I was actually going to see the Rev. Falwell on a different matter, the future of Jerusalem, but I thought I might just slip this question--the one about me maybe being the Antichrist--into the stream of the interview. Falwell, I guessed, wouldn't be happy to discuss his views on the identity of the Antichrist--he had apologized for the remark but took quite a load of grief for it anyway. 

         As it turned out, though, Falwell was eager to talk about the Antichrist

Question:
What is the author referencing when they say Christian imperialism?

Options:
A: The attempt to change Judaism to include Jesus as messiah
B: The attempt to include Muhammad
C: The New World being colonized by Christians
D: The crusades and other violent acts of Christians

### REAL QUESTION — ANSWER THIS ONLY ###
Passage:
I, Antichrist? 

         Early one shiny autumn morning, I got in my car and drove to Lynchburg, Va., in order to find out whether or not I am the Antichrist. You know: the Beast, the Worthless Shepherd, the Little Horn, the Abomination, the linchpin of the Diabolical Trinity. That Antichrist. 

         I had my suspicions. Nowhere on my body could I find the mark of the Beast--666--but I do have a freckle that's shaped like Bermuda. And though I have never been seized by a desire to lead the armies of Satan in a final, bloody confrontation with the forces of God on the plain of Armageddon, I do suffer from aggravated dyspepsia, as well as chronic malaise, conditions that I'm sure afflict the Antichrist. 

         The surest suspicion I had about my pivotal role in Christian eschatology grew from the fact that I am Jewish, male, and alive. These are the qualifications for the job of Antichrist as specified by Lynchburg's most famous preacher, Jerry Falwell, in a speech he made earlier this year. 

         I was actually going to see the Rev. Falwell on a different matter, the future of Jerusalem, but I thought I might just slip this question--the one about me maybe being the Antichrist--into the stream of the interview. Falwell, I guessed, wouldn't be happy to discuss his views on the identity of the Antichrist--he had apologized for the remark but took quite a load of grief for it anyway. 

         As it turned out, though, Falwell was eager to talk about the Antichrist

Question:
What effect does the author believe the Antichrist myth has on Judaism as a whole?

Options:
A: It is fuel for antisemitism
B: It is unimportant 
C: It sheds a good light on modern day Jews
D: It brings attention to the plight of the Jewish people

Passage:
THE GIRL IN HIS MIND
By ROBERT F. YOUNG


 [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from

 Worlds of Tomorrow April 1963

 Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that

 the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]
Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of
 love and lust

Question:
How much time has passed between Blake's night with Eldoria and his search for Sabrina York in his mind-world?

Options:
A: 7 years
B: 10 hours
C: 12 years
D: 1 hour

Question:
Why does Deirdre get so upset when Blake Past suggests she go to prom with the young man?

Options:
A: Because Blake is trying to guilt Deirdre into going with the young man by telling her that it'll ease her conscience. 
B: Because Deirdre has fallen in love with Blake, despite his age, and wants him to take her to the prom.  
C: Because Blake is acting like he's her father, which is a sensitive topic for Deirdre because she lost her real parents. 
D: Because the young man gave up his right arm in order to afford tickets to the prom, and this disgusts Deirdre.

### REAL QUESTION — ANSWER THIS ONLY ###
Passage:
I, Antichrist? 

         Early one shiny autumn morning, I got in my car and drove to Lynchburg, Va., in order to find out whether or not I am the Antichrist. You know: the Beast, the Worthless Shepherd, the Little Horn, the Abomination, the linchpin of the Diabolical Trinity. That Antichrist. 

         I had my suspicions. Nowhere on my body could I find the mark of the Beast--666--but I do have a freckle that's shaped like Bermuda. And though I have never been seized by a desire to lead the armies of Satan in a final, bloody confrontation with the forces of God on the plain of Armageddon, I do suffer from aggravated dyspepsia, as well as chronic malaise, conditions that I'm sure afflict the Antichrist. 

         The surest suspicion I had about my pivotal role in Christian eschatology grew from the fact that I am Jewish, male, and alive. These are the qualifications for the job of Antichrist as specified by Lynchburg's most famous preacher, Jerry Falwell, in a speech he made earlier this year. 

         I was actually going to see the Rev. Falwell on a different matter, the future of Jerusalem, but I thought I might just slip this question--the one about me maybe being the Antichrist--into the stream of the interview. Falwell, I guessed, wouldn't be happy to discuss his views on the identity of the Antichrist--he had apologized for the remark but took quite a load of grief for it anyway. 

         As it turned out, though, Falwell was eager to talk about the Antichrist

Question:
What is the most problematic aspect about LaHaye's antisemitism?

Options:
A: It is blatant and outspoken
B: He draws on historical literature from Judaism
C: He is one of the best-selling Christian authors
D: It is thinly veiled in confusing language

### REAL QUESTION — ANSWER THIS ONLY ###
Passage:
I, Antichrist? 

         Early one shiny autumn morning, I got in my car and drove to Lynchburg, Va., in order to find out whether or not I am the Antichrist. You know: the Beast, the Worthless Shepherd, the Little Horn, the Abomination, the linchpin of the Diabolical Trinity. That Antichrist. 

         I had my suspicions. Nowhere on my body could I find the mark of the Beast--666--but I do have a freckle that's shaped like Bermuda. And though I have never been seized by a desire to lead the armies of Satan in a final, bloody confrontation with the forces of God on the plain of Armageddon, I do suffer from aggravated dyspepsia, as well as chronic malaise, conditions that I'm sure afflict the Antichrist. 

         The surest suspicion I had about my pivotal role in Christian eschatology grew from the fact that I am Jewish, male, and alive. These are the qualifications for the job of Antichrist as specified by Lynchburg's most famous preacher, Jerry Falwell, in a speech he made earlier this year. 

         I was actually going to see the Rev. Falwell on a different matter, the future of Jerusalem, but I thought I might just slip this question--the one about me maybe being the Antichrist--into the stream of the interview. Falwell, I guessed, wouldn't be happy to discuss his views on the identity of the Antichrist--he had apologized for the remark but took quite a load of grief for it anyway. 

         As it turned out, though, Falwell was eager to talk about the Antichrist

Question:
Why doesn't Falwell believe that the author could be the Antichrist?

Options:
A: The author is not evil
B: The Antichrist would not have any doubts
C: The author is not a world leader
D: The author is not Jewish

### REAL QUESTION — ANSWER THIS ONLY ###
Passage:
I, Antichrist? 

         Early one shiny autumn morning, I got in my car and drove to Lynchburg, Va., in order to find out whether or not I am the Antichrist. You know: the Beast, the Worthless Shepherd, the Little Horn, the Abomination, the linchpin of the Diabolical Trinity. That Antichrist. 

         I had my suspicions. Nowhere on my body could I find the mark of the Beast--666--but I do have a freckle that's shaped like Bermuda. And though I have never been seized by a desire to lead the armies of Satan in a final, bloody confrontation with the forces of God on the plain of Armageddon, I do suffer from aggravated dyspepsia, as well as chronic malaise, conditions that I'm sure afflict the Antichrist. 

         The surest suspicion I had about my pivotal role in Christian eschatology grew from the fact that I am Jewish, male, and alive. These are the qualifications for the job of Antichrist as specified by Lynchburg's most famous preacher, Jerry Falwell, in a speech he made earlier this year. 

         I was actually going to see the Rev. Falwell on a different matter, the future of Jerusalem, but I thought I might just slip this question--the one about me maybe being the Antichrist--into the stream of the interview. Falwell, I guessed, wouldn't be happy to discuss his views on the identity of the Antichrist--he had apologized for the remark but took quite a load of grief for it anyway. 

         As it turned out, though, Falwell was eager to talk about the Antichrist

Question:
Why does LaHaye believe that Jewish suffering is deserved?

Options:
A: He believes that Antichrist will almost certainly be Jewish
B: The actions of certain atheist Jews historically
C: It was prophesied in the Bible 
D: They are counterfeit of the true Christ

### REAL QUESTION — ANSWER THIS ONLY ###
Passage:
I, Antichrist? 

         Early one shiny autumn morning, I got in my car and drove to Lynchburg, Va., in order to find out whether or not I am the Antichrist. You know: the Beast, the Worthless Shepherd, the Little Horn, the Abomination, the linchpin of the Diabolical Trinity. That Antichrist. 

         I had my suspicions. Nowhere on my body could I find the mark of the Beast--666--but I do have a freckle that's shaped like Bermuda. And though I have never been seized by a desire to lead the armies of Satan in a final, bloody confrontation with the forces of God on the plain of Armageddon, I do suffer from aggravated dyspepsia, as well as chronic malaise, conditions that I'm sure afflict the Antichrist. 

         The surest suspicion I had about my pivotal role in Christian eschatology grew from the fact that I am Jewish, male, and alive. These are the qualifications for the job of Antichrist as specified by Lynchburg's most famous preacher, Jerry Falwell, in a speech he made earlier this year. 

         I was actually going to see the Rev. Falwell on a different matter, the future of Jerusalem, but I thought I might just slip this question--the one about me maybe being the Antichrist--into the stream of the interview. Falwell, I guessed, wouldn't be happy to discuss his views on the identity of the Antichrist--he had apologized for the remark but took quite a load of grief for it anyway. 

         As it turned out, though, Falwell was eager to talk about the Antichrist

Question:
What is implied at the end of the passage by the author about Barry Diller?

Options:
A: That he is Jewish, gay, and famous
B: That he believes that Antichrist has come
C: That he will be a world leader some day
D: That he is an anti-semite

Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of
 love and lust

Here's what happens when two Master
 
Spies tangle ... and stay that way!
"Nothing, nothing to get upset about," Pashkov said soothingly, taking
 his friend's arm as they came out of the villa forty miles from Moscow.
 Pashkov looked like a roly-poly zoo attendant leading a tame bear.
 "Erase his memory, give him a new name and feed him more patriotism.
 Very simple."


 Medvedev raised his hand threateningly. "Don't come howling to me if
 everybody guesses he is nothing but a robot."


 Pashkov glanced back at the house. Since the publication of
Dentist
 Amigovitch
, this house had become known all over the world as Boris
 Knackenpast's villa. Now the house was guarded by a company of
 soldiers to keep visitors out. From an open window Pashkov heard the
 clicking of a typewriter.


 "It's when they're not like robots that everybody suspects them," he
 said, climbing into his flier. "Petchareff will send you word when to
 announce his 'death'."


 "A question, brother."


 "No questions."


 "Who smuggled the manuscript out of Russia?"


 Pashkov frowned convincingly. "Comrade Petchareff has suspected even
 me."

Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the

Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."

Spies tangle ... and stay that way!

 his friend's arm as they came out of the villa forty miles from Moscow.
 Pashkov looked like a roly-poly zoo attendant leading a tame bear.
 "Erase his memory, give him a new name and feed him more patriotism.

 Medvedev raised his hand threateningly. "Don't come howling to me if

 said, climbing into his flier. "Petchareff will send you word when to
 announce his 'death'."


 "A question, brother."


 "No questions."

THE GIRL IN HIS MIND
By ROBERT F. YOUNG


 [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from

 Worlds of Tomorrow April 1963

 Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that

 the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]
Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of
 love and lust

Question:
How much time has passed between Blake's night with Eldoria and his search for Sabrina York in his mind-world?

Options:
A: 7 years
B: 10 hours
C: 12 years
D: 1 hour

Here's what happens when two Master
 
Spies tangle ... and stay that way!
"Nothing, nothing to get upset about," Pashkov said soothingly, taking
 his friend's arm as they came out of the villa forty miles from Moscow.
 Pashkov looked like a roly-poly zoo attendant leading a tame bear.
 "Erase his memory, give him a new name and feed him more patriotism.
 Very simple."


 Medvedev raised his hand threateningly. "Don't come howling to me if
 everybody guesses he is nothing but a robot."


 Pashkov glanced back at the house. Since the publication of
Dentist
 Amigovitch
, this house had become known all over the world as Boris
 Knackenpast's villa. Now the house was guarded by a company of
 soldiers to keep visitors out. From an open window Pashkov heard the
 clicking of a typewriter.


 "It's when they're not like robots that everybody suspects them," he
 said, climbing into his flier. "Petchareff will send you word when to
 announce his 'death'."


 "A question, brother."


 "No questions."


 "Who smuggled the manuscript out of Russia?"


 Pashkov frowned convincingly. "Comrade Petchareff has suspected even
 me."


 He took off for Moscow, poking his flier up through the clouds and
 flying close to them, as was his habit. Then h

Question:
How will Nadezhda know if Pashkov is the true Pashkov?

Options:
A: She will be able to tell by looking at this cheekbone. 
B: Since they are romantically involved, she will be able to see the mole that distinguishes the true Pashkov. 
C: Since they are romantically involved, she knows his true voice. 
D: She is his sister, so their DNA will match.

 Medvedev raised his hand threateningly. "Don't come howling to me if
 everybody guesses he is nothing but a robot."


 Pashkov glanced back at the house. Since the publication of
Dentist
 Amigovitch
, this house had become known all over the world as Boris
 Knackenpast's villa. Now the house was guarded by a company of
 soldiers to keep visitors out. From an open window Pashkov heard the
 clicking of a typewriter.


 "It's when they're not like robots that everybody suspects them," he
 said, climbing into his flier. "Petchareff will send you word when to
 announce his 'death'."


 "A question, brother."


 "No questions."


 "Who smuggled the manuscript out of Russia?"


 Pashkov frowned convincingly. "Comrade Petchareff has suspected even
 me."


 He took off for Moscow, poking his flier up through the clouds and
 flying close to them, as was his habit. Then h

THE MOONS OF MARS

 Galaxy Science Fiction September 1952.

 Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that

Every boy should be able to whistle, except,
 
of course, Martians. But this one did!
He seemed a very little boy to be carrying so large a butterfly net. He
 swung it in his chubby right fist as he walked, and at first glance you
 couldn't be sure if he were carrying it, or it carrying
him
.


 He came whistling. All little boys whistle. To little boys, whistling
 is as natural as breathing. However, there was something peculiar about
 this particular little boy's whistling. Or, rather, there were two
 things peculiar, but each was related to the other.


 The first was that he was a Martian little boy. You could be very sure
 of that, for Earth little boys have earlobes while Martian little boys
 do not—and he most certainly didn't.


 The second was the tune he whistled—a somehow familiar tune, but one
 which I should have thought not very appealing to a little boy.


 "Hi, there," I said when he came near enough. "What's that you're
 whistling?"


 He stopped whistling and he stopped walking, both at the same time, as
 though he had pulled a switch or turned a tap that shut them off. Then
 he lifted his little head and stared up into my eyes.


 "'The Calm'," he said in a sober, little-boy voice.

 He came whistling. All little boys whistle. To little boys, whistling

Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of
 love and lust

Every boy should be able to whistle, except,
 
of course, Martians. But this one did!
He seemed a very little boy to be carrying so large a butterfly net. He
 swung it in his chubby right fist as he walked, and at first glance you
 couldn't be sure if he were carrying it, or it carrying
him

 He came whistling. All little boys whistle. To little boys, whistling
 is as natural as breathing. However, there was something peculiar about
 this particular little boy's whistling. Or, rather, there were two
 things peculiar, but each was related to the other.


 The first was that he was a Martian little boy. You could be very sure
 of that, for Earth little boys have earlobes while Martian little boys
 do not—and he most certainly didn't.


 The second was the tune he whistled—a somehow familiar tune, but one
 which I should have thought not very appealing to a little boy.


 "Hi, there," I said when he came near enough. "What's that you're
 whistling?"


 He stopped whistling and he stopped walking, both at the same time, as
 though he had pulled a switch or turned a tap that shut them off. Then
 he lifted his little head and stared up into my eyes.

of course, Martians. But this one did!
He seemed a very little boy to be carrying so large a butterfly net. He
 swung it in his chubby right fist as he walked, and at first glance you
 couldn't be sure if he were carrying it, or it carrying

 He came whistling. All little boys whistle. To little boys, whistling
 is as natural as breathing. However, there was something peculiar about
 this particular little boy's whistling. Or, rather, there were two

 The first was that he was a Martian little boy. You could be very sure
 of that, for Earth little boys have earlobes while Martian little boys
 do not—and he most certainly didn't.


 The second was the tune he whistled—a somehow familiar tune, but one
 which I should have thought not very appealing to a little boy.


 "Hi, there," I said when he came near enough. "What's that you're
 whistling?"


 He stopped whistling and he stopped walking, both at the same time, as
 though he had pulled a switch or turned a tap that shut them off. Then
 he lifted his little head and stared up into my eyes.

 He stopped whistling and he stopped walking, both at the same time, as

Every man's mind is a universe with countless

Every boy should be able to whistle, except,
 
of course, Martians. But this one did!
He seemed a very little boy to be carrying so large a butterfly net. He
 swung it in his chubby right fist as he walked, and at first glance you
 couldn't be sure if he were carrying it, or it carrying

 He came whistling. All little boys whistle. To little boys, whistling
 is as natural as breathing. However, there was something peculiar about
 this particular little boy's whistling. Or, rather, there were two

 The first was that he was a Martian little boy. You could be very sure
 of that, for Earth little boys have earlobes while Martian little boys
 do not—and he most certainly didn't.


 The second was the tune he whistled—a somehow familiar tune, but one
 which I should have thought not very appealing to a little boy.


 "Hi, there," I said when he came near enough. "What's that you're
 whistling?"


 He stopped whistling and he stopped walking, both at the same time, as
 though he had pulled a switch or turned a tap that shut them off. Then
 he lifted his little head and stared up into my eyes.

Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of

Every boy should be able to whistle, except,
 
of course, Martians. But this one did!
He seemed a very little boy to be carrying so large a butterfly net. He
 swung it in his chubby right fist as he walked, and at first glance you
 couldn't be sure if he were carrying it, or it carrying
him
.


 He came whistling. All little boys whistle. To little boys, whistling
 is as natural as breathing. However, there was something peculiar about

THE GIRL IN HIS MIND
By ROBERT F. YOUNG

 Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that

 the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]
Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of
 love and lust

Question:
How much time has passed between Blake's night with Eldoria and his search for Sabrina York in his mind-world?

Options:
A: 7 years
B: 10 hours
C: 12 years
D: 1 hour

B: Because Deirdre has fallen in love with Blake, despite his age, and wants him to take her to the prom.  
C: Because Blake is acting like he's her father, which is a sensitive topic for Deirdre because she lost her real parents.

Every boy should be able to whistle, except,
 
of course, Martians. But this one did!
He seemed a very little boy to be carrying so large a butterfly net. He
 swung it in his chubby right fist as he walked, and at first glance you
 couldn't be sure if he were carrying it, or it carrying
him
.


 He came whistling. All little boys whistle. To little boys, whistling
 is as natural as breathing. However, there was something peculiar about
 this particular little boy's whistling. Or, rather, there were two
 things peculiar, but each was related to the other.


 The first was that he was a Martian little boy. You could be very sure
 of that, for Earth little boys have earlobes while Martian little boys
 do not—and he most certainly didn't.


 The second was the tune he whistled—a somehow familiar tune, but one
 which I should have thought not very appealing to a little boy.


 "Hi, there," I said when he came near enough. "What's that you're
 whistling?"


 He stopped whistling and he stopped walking, both at the same time, as
 though he had pulled a switch or turned a tap that shut them off. Then
 he lifted his little head and stared up into my eyes.


 "'The Calm'," he said in a sober, little-boy voice.

Perhaps \\"broadly\\" is putting too fine a point on it. The first hour, in which Arthur Sullivan (Allan Corduner) attempts to sever his ties with W.S. Gilbert (Jim Broadbent) and the owner of the Savoy, Richard D\'Oyly Carte (Ron Cook), is a mess: The order of scenes feels arbitrary, and characters pop up and vanish with bewildering frequency. You might be tempted to vanish, too. (Friends of mine did.) Be patient. Leigh\'s movies, born of actors\' improvisations and loosely shaped, always take a while to find their rhythm--and, frequently, their point. This one finds everything. By the end of its two hours and 40 minutes, Topsy-Turvy has evolved into something extraordinary: a monument to process--to the minutiae of making art. And to something more: the fundamental sadness of people who labor to make beautiful things--who soar--and then come down to a not-so-beautiful earth. \\n\\n         It would be charitable to attribute the shapelessness of the early scenes to the characters\' own lack of focus, but it would also be inane.

### REAL QUESTION — ANSWER THIS ONLY ###
Passage:
Grand Finale 

         Mike Leigh's 

               Topsy-Turvy                 broadly recounts the creation of Gilbert and Sullivan's comic opera The Mikado at London's Savoy Theatre in 1885. Perhaps "broadly" is putting too fine a point on it. The first hour, in which Arthur Sullivan (Allan Corduner) attempts to sever his ties with W.S. Gilbert (Jim Broadbent) and the owner of the Savoy, Richard D'Oyly Carte (Ron Cook), is a mess: The order of scenes feels arbitrary, and characters pop up and vanish with bewildering frequency. You might be tempted to vanish, too. (Friends of mine did.) Be patient. Leigh's movies, born of actors' improvisations and loosely shaped, always take a while to find their rhythm--and, frequently, their point. This one finds everything. By the end of its two hours and 40 minutes, Topsy-Turvy has evolved into something extraordinary: a monument to process--to the minutiae of making art. And to something more: the fundamental sadness of people who labor to make beautiful things--who soar--and then come down to a not-so-beautiful earth. 

         It would be charitable to attribute the shapelessness of the early scenes to the characters' own lack of focus, but it would also be inane. As Elvis Mitchell pointed out in

THE GIRL IN HIS MIND
By ROBERT F. YOUNG

 Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that

 the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]
Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of
 love and lust

Question:
How much time has passed between Blake's night with Eldoria and his search for Sabrina York in his mind-world?

Options:
A: 7 years
B: 10 hours

         Mike Leigh's 

               Topsy-Turvy                 broadly recounts the creation of Gilbert and Sullivan's comic opera The Mikado at London's Savoy Theatre in 1885. Perhaps "broadly" is putting too fine a point on it. The first hour, in which Arthur Sullivan (Allan Corduner) attempts to sever his ties with W.S. Gilbert (Jim Broadbent) and the owner of the Savoy, Richard D'Oyly Carte (Ron Cook), is a mess: The order of scenes feels arbitrary, and characters pop up and vanish with bewildering frequency. You might be tempted to vanish, too. (Friends of mine did.) Be patient. Leigh's movies, born of actors' improvisations and loosely shaped, always take a while to find their rhythm--and, frequently, their point. This one finds everything. By the end of its two hours and 40 minutes, Topsy-Turvy has evolved into something extraordinary: a monument to process--to the minutiae of making art. And to something more: the fundamental sadness of people who labor to make beautiful things--who soar--and then come down to a not-so-beautiful earth.

### REAL QUESTION — ANSWER THIS ONLY ###
Passage:
Grand Finale 

         Mike Leigh's 

               Topsy-Turvy                 broadly recounts the creation of Gilbert and Sullivan's comic opera The Mikado at London's Savoy Theatre in 1885. Perhaps "broadly" is putting too fine a point on it. The first hour, in which Arthur Sullivan (Allan Corduner) attempts to sever his ties with W.S. Gilbert (Jim Broadbent) and the owner of the Savoy, Richard D'Oyly Carte (Ron Cook), is a mess: The order of scenes feels arbitrary, and characters pop up and vanish with bewildering frequency. You might be tempted to vanish, too. (Friends of mine did.) Be patient. Leigh's movies, born of actors' improvisations and loosely shaped, always take a while to find their rhythm--and, frequently, their point. This one finds everything. By the end of its two hours and 40 minutes, Topsy-Turvy has evolved into something extraordinary: a monument to process--to the minutiae of making art. And to something more: the fundamental sadness of people who labor to make beautiful things--who soar--and then come down to a not-so-beautiful earth. 

         It would be charitable to attribute the shapelessness of the early scenes to the characters' own lack of focus, but it would also be inane. As Elvis Mitchell pointed out in

Perhaps \"broadly\" is putting too fine a point on it. The first hour, in which Arthur Sullivan (Allan Corduner) attempts to sever his ties with W.S. Gilbert (Jim Broadbent) and the owner of the Savoy, Richard D'Oyly Carte (Ron Cook), is a mess: The order of scenes feels arbitrary, and characters pop up and vanish with bewildering frequency. You might be tempted to vanish, too. (Friends of mine did.) Be patient. Leigh's movies, born of actors' improvisations and loosely shaped, always take a while to find their rhythm--and, frequently, their point. This one finds everything. By the end of its two hours and 40 minutes, Topsy-Turvy has evolved into something extraordinary: a monument to process--to the minutiae of making art. And to something more: the fundamental sadness of people who labor to make beautiful things--who soar--and then come down to a not-so-beautiful earth. \n\n         It would be charitable to attribute the shapelessness of the early scenes to the characters' own lack of focus, but it would also be inane. As Elvis Mitchell pointed out in \n\n               Slate                's \",\" Leigh's opening shot features an usher who moves along a row of the Savoy Theatre lifting and peering under every seat. That's every seat. You can almost hear Leigh cackling: \"How's this for a\n\nQuestion:\nHow does the author feel about the documentary?\n\nOptions:\nA: It is excellent.\nB: It is poorly executed. \nC: The subject matter is boring. \nD: The information is educational. \n\n\nYour Answer:", "role": "user", "name": null, "raw": false}], "model": "rwkv", "stream": false, "stop": ["\n\nUser", "\n\nQuestion", "\n\nQ", "\n\nHuman", "\n\nBob", "\n\nAssistant", "\n\nAnswer", "\n\nA", "\n\nBot", "\n\nAlice", "\n\nObservation", "\n\nUser", "\n\nAss"], "tools": null, "tool_choice": "auto", "user_name": null, "assistant_name": null, "system_name": null, "presystem": false}

Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of
 love and lust

Let the dead past bury its dead?
 
Not while I am alive, it won't!
It surely was all right for me to let myself do it now. I couldn't have
 been more safe. In the window of the radio store a color television
 set was enjoying a quiz by itself and creased in my pocket was the
 newspaper account of the failure of a monumental human adventure in the
 blooming extinction of a huge rocket. The boys on the corner seemed
 hardly human, scowling anthropoids in walrus-skin coats. It was my own
 time. Anybody could see I was safe, and I could risk doing what I ached
 to do.


 I turned the corner.


 The breaks were against me from the start. It didn't come as any
 surprise. I could never get away with it. I knew that all along.


 There was a Packard parked just beyond the fire plug.


 The metal and glass fronts of the buildings didn't show back here, only
 seasoned brick glued with powdering chalk. The line of the block seemed
 to stretch back, ever further away from the glossy fronts into the
 crumbling stone.


 A man brushed past me, wearing an Ivy League suit and snap-brim hat,
 carrying a briefcase. And, reassuringly, he was in a hurry.


 I decided to chance it. I certainly wanted to do it in the worst way.

THE GIRL IN HIS MIND
By ROBERT F. YOUNG


 [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from

 Worlds of Tomorrow April 1963

 Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that

 the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]
Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of
 love and lust

Question:
How much time has passed between Blake's night with Eldoria and his search for Sabrina York in his mind-world?

Options:
A: 7 years
B: 10 hours

THE AIR OF CASTOR OIL

 [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from

 Galaxy Magazine August 1961.

Let the dead past bury its dead?
 
Not while I am alive, it won't!
It surely was all right for me to let myself do it now. I couldn't have
 been more safe. In the window of the radio store a color television
 set was enjoying a quiz by itself and creased in my pocket was the
 newspaper account of the failure of a monumental human adventure in the
 blooming extinction of a huge rocket. The boys on the corner seemed
 hardly human, scowling anthropoids in walrus-skin coats. It was my own
 time. Anybody could see I was safe, and I could risk doing what I ached
 to do.


 I turned the corner.


 The breaks were against me from the start. It didn't come as any
 surprise. I could never get away with it. I knew that all along.


 There was a Packard parked just beyond the fire plug.


 The metal and glass fronts of the buildings didn't show back here, only
 seasoned brick glued with powdering chalk. The line of the block seemed
 to stretch back, ever further away from the glossy fronts into the
 crumbling stone.


 A man brushed past me, wearing an Ivy League suit and snap-brim hat,
 carrying a briefcase. And, reassuringly, he was in a hurry.


 I decided to chance it. I certainly wanted to do it in the worst way.

Question:

Passage:
THE GIRL IN HIS MIND
By ROBERT F. YOUNG


 [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from

 Worlds of Tomorrow April 1963

 Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that

 the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]
Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of
 love and lust

Question:
How much time has passed between Blake's night with Eldoria and his search for Sabrina York in his mind-world?

Options:
A: 7 years
B: 10 hours
C: 12 years
D: 1 hour

Correct Answer: B

C: Because Blake is acting like he's her father, which is a sensitive topic for Deirdre because she lost her real parents.

THE AIR OF CASTOR OIL
BY JIM HARMON


 Illustrated by WALKER


 [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from

 Galaxy Magazine August 1961.

Let the dead past bury its dead?
 
Not while I am alive, it won't!
It surely was all right for me to let myself do it now. I couldn't have
 been more safe. In the window of the radio store a color television
 set was enjoying a quiz by itself and creased in my pocket was the
 newspaper account of the failure of a monumental human adventure in the
 blooming extinction of a huge rocket. The boys on the corner seemed
 hardly human, scowling anthropoids in walrus-skin coats. It was my own
 time. Anybody could see I was safe, and I could risk doing what I ached
 to do.


 I turned the corner.


 The breaks were against me from the start. It didn't come as any
 surprise. I could never get away with it. I knew that all along.


 There was a Packard parked just beyond the fire plug.


 The metal and glass fronts of the buildings didn't show back here, only
 seasoned brick glued with powdering chalk. The line of the block seemed
 to stretch back, ever further away from the glossy fronts into the
 crumbling stone.


 A man brushed past me, wearing an Ivy League suit and snap-brim hat,
 carrying a briefcase. And, reassuringly, he was in a hurry.


 I decided to chance it. I certainly wanted to do it in the worst way.


 My footsteps car
