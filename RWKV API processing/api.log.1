Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7

 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of

Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of
 love and lust

Let the dead past bury its dead?
 
Not while I am alive, it won't!
It surely was all right for me to let myself do it now. I couldn't have
 been more safe. In the window of the radio store a color television
 set was enjoying a quiz by itself and creased in my pocket was the
 newspaper account of the failure of a monumental human adventure in the
 blooming extinction of a huge rocket. The boys on the corner seemed
 hardly human, scowling anthropoids in walrus-skin coats. It was my own
 time. Anybody could see I was safe, and I could risk doing what I ached
 to do.


 I turned the corner.


 The breaks were against me from the start. It didn't come as any
 surprise. I could never get away with it. I knew that all along.


 There was a Packard parked just beyond the fire plug.


 The metal and glass fronts of the buildings didn't show back here, only
 seasoned brick glued with powdering chalk. The line of the block seemed
 to stretch back, ever further away from the glossy fronts into the

 A man brushed past me, wearing an Ivy League suit and snap-brim hat,
 carrying a briefcase. And, reassuringly, he was in a hurry.


 I decided to chance it. I certainly wanted to do it in the worst way.

Passage:
THE GIRL IN HIS MIND
By ROBERT F. YOUNG


 [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from

 Worlds of Tomorrow April 1963

 Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that

 the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]
Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of
 love and lust

Question:
How much time has passed between Blake's night with Eldoria and his search for Sabrina York in his mind-world?

Options:
A: 7 years
B: 10 hours

THE AIR OF CASTOR OIL
BY JIM HARMON


 Illustrated by WALKER


 [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from

 Galaxy Magazine August 1961.

 Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that

 the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]
Let the dead past bury its dead?
 
Not while I am alive, it won't!
It surely was all right for me to let myself do it now. I couldn't have
 been more safe. In the window of the radio store a color television
 set was enjoying a quiz by itself and creased in my pocket was the
 newspaper account of the failure of a monumental human adventure in the
 blooming extinction of a huge rocket. The boys on the corner seemed
 hardly human, scowling anthropoids in walrus-skin coats. It was my own
 time. Anybody could see I was safe, and I could risk doing what I ached
 to do.


 I turned the corner.


 The breaks were against me from the start. It didn't come as any
 surprise. I could never get away with it. I knew that all along.


 There was a Packard parked just beyond the fire plug.


 The metal and glass fronts of the buildings didn't show back here, only
 seasoned brick glued with powdering chalk. The line of the block seemed
 to stretch back, ever further away from the glossy fronts into the
 crumbling stone.


 A man brushed past me, wearing an Ivy League suit and snap-brim hat,
 carrying a briefcase. And, reassuringly, he was in a hurry.


 I decided to chance it. I certainly wanted to do it in the worst way.


 My footsteps car

Question:
When does the story take place?

Options:
A: 1950s
B: 1930s
C: 1940s

Passage:
THE GIRL IN HIS MIND
By ROBERT F. YOUNG


 [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from

 Worlds of Tomorrow April 1963

 Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that

 the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]
Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of
 love and lust

Question:
How much time has passed between Blake's night with Eldoria and his search for Sabrina York in his mind-world?

Options:
A: 7 years
B: 10 hours
C: 12 years
D: 1 hour

Correct Answer: B

THE AIR OF CASTOR OIL
BY JIM HARMON


 Illustrated by WALKER

 Galaxy Magazine August 1961.

Let the dead past bury its dead?
 
Not while I am alive, it won't!
It surely was all right for me to let myself do it now. I couldn't have
 been more safe. In the window of the radio store a color television
 set was enjoying a quiz by itself and creased in my pocket was the
 newspaper account of the failure of a monumental human adventure in the
 blooming extinction of a huge rocket. The boys on the corner seemed
 hardly human, scowling anthropoids in walrus-skin coats. It was my own
 time. Anybody could see I was safe, and I could risk doing what I ached
 to do.


 I turned the corner.


 The breaks were against me from the start. It didn't come as any
 surprise. I could never get away with it. I knew that all along.


 There was a Packard parked just beyond the fire plug.


 The metal and glass fronts of the buildings didn't show back here, only
 seasoned brick glued with powdering chalk. The line of the block seemed
 to stretch back, ever further away from the glossy fronts into the
 crumbling stone.


 A man brushed past me, wearing an Ivy League suit and snap-brim hat,
 carrying a briefcase. And, reassuringly, he was in a hurry.


 I decided to chance it. I certainly wanted to do it in the worst way.

Question:

Let the dead past bury its dead?
 
Not while I am alive, it won't!
It surely was all right for me to let myself do it now. I couldn't have
 been more safe. In the window of the radio store a color television
 set was enjoying a quiz by itself and creased in my pocket was the
 newspaper account of the failure of a monumental human adventure in the
 blooming extinction of a huge rocket. The boys on the corner seemed
 hardly human, scowling anthropoids in walrus-skin coats. It was my own
 time. Anybody could see I was safe, and I could risk doing what I ached
 to do.


 I turned the corner.


 The breaks were against me from the start. It didn't come as any
 surprise. I could never get away with it. I knew that all along.


 There was a Packard parked just beyond the fire plug.


 The metal and glass fronts of the buildings didn't show back here, only
 seasoned brick glued with powdering chalk. The line of the block seemed
 to stretch back, ever further away from the glossy fronts into the
 crumbling stone.


 A man brushed past me, wearing an Ivy League suit and snap-brim hat,
 carrying a briefcase. And, reassuringly, he was in a hurry.


 I decided to chance it. I certainly wanted to do it in the worst way.

THE GIRL IN HIS MIND
By ROBERT F. YOUNG


 [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from

 Worlds of Tomorrow April 1963

 Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that

 the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]
Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of
 love and lust

Passage:
THE GIRL IN HIS MIND
By ROBERT F. YOUNG


 [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from

 Worlds of Tomorrow April 1963

 Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that

 the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]
Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of
 love and lust

Question:
How much time has passed between Blake's night with Eldoria and his search for Sabrina York in his mind-world?

Options:
A: 7 years
B: 10 hours
C: 12 years
D: 1 hour

Question:
Why does Deirdre get so upset when Blake Past suggests she go to prom with the young man?

Options:
A: Because Blake is trying to guilt Deirdre into going with the young man by telling her that it'll ease her conscience. 
B: Because Deirdre has fallen in love with Blake, despite his age, and wants him to take her to the prom.  
C: Because Blake is acting like he's her father, which is a sensitive topic for Deirdre because she lost her real parents. 
D: Because the young man gave up his right arm in order to afford tickets to the prom, and this disgusts Deirdre.

### REAL QUESTION — ANSWER THIS ONLY ###
Passage:
Kick Me 

         Not long ago, out of curiosity, I picked up some exercise videos by Billy Blanks, the king of Tae-Bo. What a flop. The sets were cheesy, the music was awful 1980s synth-pop, and despite their martial-arts pretensions, the routines felt more like aerobics in disguise than like kung fu. But after flailing away in my living room for a few nights, my interest was piqued, and I decided to find out more about the real thing. Which martial art teaches good self-defense tactics? Which one would give me a good aerobic workout? How daunting would it be to jump into a class as a complete beginner? And would I get pummeled by the other students? 

         To find out, I tried a handful of karate, tae kwon do, aikido, jujitsu, and kung fu classes in the Seattle area. I scored each one in several areas: how intimidating the class would be to a novice; how much the exercises worked my muscles; how much of an I got; whether it would develop coordination and balance; how much physical contact with other people was involved; and, of course, its value in self-defense. All ratings are on a scale of one to five, with five being the hardest, most intimidating, or most valuable. 

         To experts, this will look like a hopelessly biased and superficial inquiry. It is. But to beginners, it is one step toward figuring out which martial art might be right for you.

### REAL QUESTION — ANSWER THIS ONLY ###
Passage:
Kick Me 

         Not long ago, out of curiosity, I picked up some exercise videos by Billy Blanks, the king of Tae-Bo. What a flop. The sets were cheesy, the music was awful 1980s synth-pop, and despite their martial-arts pretensions, the routines felt more like aerobics in disguise than like kung fu. But after flailing away in my living room for a few nights, my interest was piqued, and I decided to find out more about the real thing. Which martial art teaches good self-defense tactics? Which one would give me a good aerobic workout? How daunting would it be to jump into a class as a complete beginner? And would I get pummeled by the other students? 

         To find out, I tried a handful of karate, tae kwon do, aikido, jujitsu, and kung fu classes in the Seattle area. I scored each one in several areas: how intimidating the class would be to a novice; how much the exercises worked my muscles; how much of an I got; whether it would develop coordination and balance; how much physical contact with other people was involved; and, of course, its value in self-defense. All ratings are on a scale of one to five, with five being the hardest, most intimidating, or most valuable. 

         To experts, this will look like a hopelessly biased and superficial inquiry. It is. But to beginners, it is one step toward figuring out which martial art might be right for you. Do you want a chance to kick the stuffing out of someone? Take tae kwon do. Do you want to improve your sense of ba

Passage:
THE GIRL IN HIS MIND
By ROBERT F. YOUNG


 [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from

 Worlds of Tomorrow April 1963

 Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that

 the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]
Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of
 love and lust

Question:
How much time has passed between Blake's night with Eldoria and his search for Sabrina York in his mind-world?

Options:
A: 7 years
B: 10 hours
C: 12 years

Passage:
THE GIRL IN HIS MIND
By ROBERT F. YOUNG


 [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from

 Worlds of Tomorrow April 1963

 Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that

 the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]
Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of
 love and lust

Question:
How much time has passed between Blake's night with Eldoria and his search for Sabrina York in his mind-world?

Options:
A: 7 years
B: 10 hours
C: 12 years
D: 1 hour

Passage:
THE GIRL IN HIS MIND
By ROBERT F. YOUNG

 the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]
Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of
 love and lust

Question:
How much time has passed between Blake's night with Eldoria and his search for Sabrina York in his mind-world?

Options:
A: 7 years
B: 10 hours
C: 12 years
D: 1 hour

Why does Deirdre get so upset when Blake Past suggests she go to prom with the young man?

Options:
A: Because Blake is trying to guilt Deirdre into going with the young man by telling her that it'll ease her conscience. 
B: Because Deirdre has fallen in love with Blake, despite his age, and wants him to take her to the prom.  
C: Because Blake is acting like he's her father, which is a sensitive topic for Deirdre because she lost her real parents. 
D: Because the young man gave up his right arm in order to afford tickets to the prom, and this disgusts Deirdre.

### REAL QUESTION — ANSWER THIS ONLY ###
Passage:
Kick Me 

         Not long ago, out of curiosity, I picked up some exercise videos by Billy Blanks, the king of Tae-Bo. What a flop. The sets were cheesy, the music was awful 1980s synth-pop, and despite their martial-arts pretensions, the routines felt more like aerobics in disguise than like kung fu. But after flailing away in my living room for a few nights, my interest was piqued, and I decided to find out more about the real thing. Which martial art teaches good self-defense tactics? Which one would give me a good aerobic workout? How daunting would it be to jump into a class as a complete beginner? And would I get pummeled by the other students? 

         To find out, I tried a handful of karate, tae kwon do, aikido, jujitsu, and kung fu classes in the Seattle area. I scored each one in several areas: how intimidating the class would be to a novice; how much the exercises worked my muscles; how much of an I got; whether it would develop coordination and balance; how much physical contact with other people was involved; and, of course, its value in self-defense. All ratings are on a scale of one to five, with five being the hardest, most intimidating, or most valuable. 

         To experts, this will look like a hopelessly biased and superficial inquiry. It is. But to beginners, it is one step toward figuring out which martial art might be right for you. Do you want a chance to kick the stuffing out of someone? Take tae kwon do. Do you want to improve your sense of ba

Question:

What a flop. The sets were cheesy, the music was awful 1980s synth-pop, and despite their martial-arts pretensions, the routines felt more like aerobics in disguise than like kung fu. But after flailing away in my living room for a few nights, my interest was piqued, and I decided to find out more about the real thing. Which martial art teaches good self-defense tactics? Which one would give me a good aerobic workout? How daunting would it be to jump into a class as a complete beginner? And would I get pummeled by the other students? \n\n         To find out, I tried a handful of karate, tae kwon do, aikido, jujitsu, and kung fu classes in the Seattle area. I scored each one in several areas: how intimidating the class would be to a novice; how much the exercises worked my muscles; how much of an I got; whether it would develop coordination and balance; how much physical contact with other people was involved; and, of course, its value in self-defense. All ratings are on a scale of one to five, with five being the hardest, most intimidating, or most valuable. \n\n         To experts, this will look like a hopelessly biased and superficial inquiry. It is. But to beginners, it is one step toward figuring out which martial art might be right for you. Do you want a chance to kick the stuffing out of someone? Take tae kwon do.

### REAL QUESTION — ANSWER THIS ONLY ###
Passage:
I, Antichrist? 

         Early one shiny autumn morning, I got in my car and drove to Lynchburg, Va., in order to find out whether or not I am the Antichrist. You know: the Beast, the Worthless Shepherd, the Little Horn, the Abomination, the linchpin of the Diabolical Trinity. That Antichrist. 

         I had my suspicions. Nowhere on my body could I find the mark of the Beast--666--but I do have a freckle that's shaped like Bermuda. And though I have never been seized by a desire to lead the armies of Satan in a final, bloody confrontation with the forces of God on the plain of Armageddon, I do suffer from aggravated dyspepsia, as well as chronic malaise, conditions that I'm sure afflict the Antichrist. 

         The surest suspicion I had about my pivotal role in Christian eschatology grew from the fact that I am Jewish, male, and alive. These are the qualifications for the job of Antichrist as specified by Lynchburg's most famous preacher, Jerry Falwell, in a speech he made earlier this year. 

         I was actually going to see the Rev. Falwell on a different matter, the future of Jerusalem, but I thought I might just slip this question--the one about me maybe being the Antichrist--into the stream of the interview. Falwell, I guessed, wouldn't be happy to discuss his views on the identity of the Antichrist--he had apologized for the remark but took quite a load of grief for it anyway. 

         As it turned out, though, Falwell was eager to talk about the Antichrist

Question:
Why does the narrator think he is the Antichrist?

Options:
A: He is gay and male. 
B: He is Jewish and an Atheist. 
C: He is Jewish and male. 
D: He is gay and European.

### REAL QUESTION — ANSWER THIS ONLY ###
Passage:
I, Antichrist? 

         Early one shiny autumn morning, I got in my car and drove to Lynchburg, Va., in order to find out whether or not I am the Antichrist. You know: the Beast, the Worthless Shepherd, the Little Horn, the Abomination, the linchpin of the Diabolical Trinity. That Antichrist. 

         I had my suspicions. Nowhere on my body could I find the mark of the Beast--666--but I do have a freckle that's shaped like Bermuda. And though I have never been seized by a desire to lead the armies of Satan in a final, bloody confrontation with the forces of God on the plain of Armageddon, I do suffer from aggravated dyspepsia, as well as chronic malaise, conditions that I'm sure afflict the Antichrist. 

         The surest suspicion I had about my pivotal role in Christian eschatology grew from the fact that I am Jewish, male, and alive. These are the qualifications for the job of Antichrist as specified by Lynchburg's most famous preacher, Jerry Falwell, in a speech he made earlier this year. 

         I was actually going to see the Rev. Falwell on a different matter, the future of Jerusalem, but I thought I might just slip this question--the one about me maybe being the Antichrist--into the stream of the interview. Falwell, I guessed, wouldn't be happy to discuss his views on the identity of the Antichrist--he had apologized for the remark but took quite a load of grief for it anyway. 

         As it turned out, though, Falwell was eager to talk about the Antichrist

Question:
Which is NOT a reason why the narrator is concerned with the antichrist?

Options:
A: Evangelical Christians are preaching that the end of the world is coming soon. 
B: He is concerned that Christians will become violent toward Jews. 
C: He thinks his life will be more important and influential than the average person.
D: He is conducting research for his dissertation.

THE GIRL IN HIS MIND
By ROBERT F. YOUNG

Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."

### REAL QUESTION — ANSWER THIS ONLY ###
Passage:
I, Antichrist? 

         Early one shiny autumn morning, I got in my car and drove to Lynchburg, Va., in order to find out whether or not I am the Antichrist. You know: the Beast, the Worthless Shepherd, the Little Horn, the Abomination, the linchpin of the Diabolical Trinity. That Antichrist. 

         I had my suspicions. Nowhere on my body could I find the mark of the Beast--666--but I do have a freckle that's shaped like Bermuda. And though I have never been seized by a desire to lead the armies of Satan in a final, bloody confrontation with the forces of God on the plain of Armageddon, I do suffer from aggravated dyspepsia, as well as chronic malaise, conditions that I'm sure afflict the Antichrist. 

         The surest suspicion I had about my pivotal role in Christian eschatology grew from the fact that I am Jewish, male, and alive. These are the qualifications for the job of Antichrist as specified by Lynchburg's most famous preacher, Jerry Falwell, in a speech he made earlier this year. 

         I was actually going to see the Rev. Falwell on a different matter, the future of Jerusalem, but I thought I might just slip this question--the one about me maybe being the Antichrist--into the stream of the interview. Falwell, I guessed, wouldn't be happy to discuss his views on the identity of the Antichrist--he had apologized for the remark but took quite a load of grief for it anyway. 

         As it turned out, though, Falwell was eager to talk about the Antichrist

Question:
How does Lahaye feel about Jews?

Options:
A: He blames Jews for much of the evil in the world. 
B: He thinks being European is worse than being Jewish. 
C: He sees Jews as the brothers and sisters of Christians. 
D: He thinks all Jews are the Antichrist.

Passage:
THE GIRL IN HIS MIND
By ROBERT F. YOUNG


 [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from

 Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that

 the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]
Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of
 love and lust

Question:
How much time has passed between Blake's night with Eldoria and his search for Sabrina York in his mind-world?

Options:
A: 7 years
B: 10 hours
C: 12 years
D: 1 hour

Correct Answer: B

Question:
Why does Deirdre get so upset when Blake Past suggests she go to prom with the young man?

Options:
A: Because Blake is trying to guilt Deirdre into going with the young man by telling her that it'll ease her conscience. 
B: Because Deirdre has fallen in love with Blake, despite his age, and wants him to take her to the prom.  
C: Because Blake is acting like he's her father, which is a sensitive topic for Deirdre because she lost her real parents. 
D: Because the young man gave up his right arm in order to afford tickets to the prom, and this disgusts Deirdre.

### REAL QUESTION — ANSWER THIS ONLY ###
Passage:
I, Antichrist? 

         Early one shiny autumn morning, I got in my car and drove to Lynchburg, Va., in order to find out whether or not I am the Antichrist. You know: the Beast, the Worthless Shepherd, the Little Horn, the Abomination, the linchpin of the Diabolical Trinity. That Antichrist. 

         I had my suspicions. Nowhere on my body could I find the mark of the Beast--666--but I do have a freckle that's shaped like Bermuda. And though I have never been seized by a desire to lead the armies of Satan in a final, bloody confrontation with the forces of God on the plain of Armageddon, I do suffer from aggravated dyspepsia, as well as chronic malaise, conditions that I'm sure afflict the Antichrist. 

         The surest suspicion I had about my pivotal role in Christian eschatology grew from the fact that I am Jewish, male, and alive. These are the qualifications for the job of Antichrist as specified by Lynchburg's most famous preacher, Jerry Falwell, in a speech he made earlier this year. 

         I was actually going to see the Rev. Falwell on a different matter, the future of Jerusalem, but I thought I might just slip this question--the one about me maybe being the Antichrist--into the stream of the interview. Falwell, I guessed, wouldn't be happy to discuss his views on the identity of the Antichrist--he had apologized for the remark but took quite a load of grief for it anyway. 

         As it turned out, though, Falwell was eager to talk about the Antichrist

Question:
According to Falwell, why will the antichrist be male and Jewish?

Options:
A: The antichrist will have similar traits to Jesus. 
B: World leaders are men. 
C: The Bible states this as fact. 
D: Women are never important people in history.

Falwell on a different matter, the future of Jerusalem, but I thought I might just slip this question--the one about me maybe being the Antichrist--into the stream of the interview. Falwell, I guessed, wouldn't be happy to discuss his views on the identity of the Antichrist--he had apologized for the remark but took quite a load of grief for it anyway. 

         As it turned out, though, Falwell was eager to talk about the Antichrist

Question:
According to Falwell, why isn’t the narrator the antichrist?

Options:
A: He is too young. 
B: He is not a powerful person. 
C: He is not Jewish. 
D: He is American.

### REAL QUESTION — ANSWER THIS ONLY ###
Passage:
I, Antichrist? 

         Early one shiny autumn morning, I got in my car and drove to Lynchburg, Va., in order to find out whether or not I am the Antichrist. You know: the Beast, the Worthless Shepherd, the Little Horn, the Abomination, the linchpin of the Diabolical Trinity. That Antichrist. 

         I had my suspicions. Nowhere on my body could I find the mark of the Beast--666--but I do have a freckle that's shaped like Bermuda. And though I have never been seized by a desire to lead the armies of Satan in a final, bloody confrontation with the forces of God on the plain of Armageddon, I do suffer from aggravated dyspepsia, as well as chronic malaise, conditions that I'm sure afflict the Antichrist. 

         The surest suspicion I had about my pivotal role in Christian eschatology grew from the fact that I am Jewish, male, and alive. These are the qualifications for the job of Antichrist as specified by Lynchburg's most famous preacher, Jerry Falwell, in a speech he made earlier this year. 

         I was actually going to see the Rev. Falwell on a different matter, the future of Jerusalem, but I thought I might just slip this question--the one about me maybe being the Antichrist--into the stream of the interview. Falwell, I guessed, wouldn't be happy to discuss his views on the identity of the Antichrist--he had apologized for the remark but took quite a load of grief for it anyway. 

         As it turned out, though, Falwell was eager to talk about the Antichrist

Question:
According to Hindson, the Antichrist will not be Jewish because

Options:
A: The Antichrist will be Atheist. 
B: The Antichrist will come from a Christian family. 
C: The Antichrist will be a world leader who will make a peace treaty with Israel. 
D: The Antichrist will be Muslim.

 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted

### REAL QUESTION — ANSWER THIS ONLY ###
Passage:
I, Antichrist? 

         Early one shiny autumn morning, I got in my car and drove to Lynchburg, Va., in order to find out whether or not I am the Antichrist. You know: the Beast, the Worthless Shepherd, the Little Horn, the Abomination, the linchpin of the Diabolical Trinity. That Antichrist. 

         I had my suspicions. Nowhere on my body could I find the mark of the Beast--666--but I do have a freckle that's shaped like Bermuda. And though I have never been seized by a desire to lead the armies of Satan in a final, bloody confrontation with the forces of God on the plain of Armageddon, I do suffer from aggravated dyspepsia, as well as chronic malaise, conditions that I'm sure afflict the Antichrist. 

         The surest suspicion I had about my pivotal role in Christian eschatology grew from the fact that I am Jewish, male, and alive. These are the qualifications for the job of Antichrist as specified by Lynchburg's most famous preacher, Jerry Falwell, in a speech he made earlier this year. 

         I was actually going to see the Rev. Falwell on a different matter, the future of Jerusalem, but I thought I might just slip this question--the one about me maybe being the Antichrist--into the stream of the interview. Falwell, I guessed, wouldn't be happy to discuss his views on the identity of the Antichrist--he had apologized for the remark but took quite a load of grief for it anyway. 

         As it turned out, though, Falwell was eager to talk about the Antichrist

Question:
What is a symbol of the Antichrist?

Options:
A: The numbers 666
B: The European Union
C: A star

THE GIRL IN HIS MIND
By ROBERT F. YOUNG


 [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from

 Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that

Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of
 love and lust

Question:
How much time has passed between Blake's night with Eldoria and his search for Sabrina York in his mind-world?

### REAL QUESTION — ANSWER THIS ONLY ###
Passage:
I, Antichrist? 

         Early one shiny autumn morning, I got in my car and drove to Lynchburg, Va., in order to find out whether or not I am the Antichrist. You know: the Beast, the Worthless Shepherd, the Little Horn, the Abomination, the linchpin of the Diabolical Trinity. That Antichrist. 

         I had my suspicions. Nowhere on my body could I find the mark of the Beast--666--but I do have a freckle that's shaped like Bermuda. And though I have never been seized by a desire to lead the armies of Satan in a final, bloody confrontation with the forces of God on the plain of Armageddon, I do suffer from aggravated dyspepsia, as well as chronic malaise, conditions that I'm sure afflict the Antichrist. 

         The surest suspicion I had about my pivotal role in Christian eschatology grew from the fact that I am Jewish, male, and alive. These are the qualifications for the job of Antichrist as specified by Lynchburg's most famous preacher, Jerry Falwell, in a speech he made earlier this year. 

         I was actually going to see the Rev. Falwell on a different matter, the future of Jerusalem, but I thought I might just slip this question--the one about me maybe being the Antichrist--into the stream of the interview. Falwell, I guessed, wouldn't be happy to discuss his views on the identity of the Antichrist--he had apologized for the remark but took quite a load of grief for it anyway. 

         As it turned out, though, Falwell was eager to talk about the Antichrist

Question:
The theories around the identity of the Antichrist lead to what kind of discrimination?

Options:
A: homophobia and Islamophobia 
B: homophobia and anti-Semitism 
C: racism and sexism
D: anti-Semitism and Islamophobia

Passage:
THE GIRL IN HIS MIND
By ROBERT F. YOUNG


 [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from

 Worlds of Tomorrow April 1963

 Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that

 the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]
Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of
 love and lust

Question:
How much time has passed between Blake's night with Eldoria and his search for Sabrina York in his mind-world?

Options:
A: 7 years
B: 10 hours
C: 12 years
D: 1 hour

Question:
Why does Deirdre get so upset when Blake Past suggests she go to prom with the young man?

Options:
A: Because Blake is trying to guilt Deirdre into going with the young man by telling her that it'll ease her conscience. 
B: Because Deirdre has fallen in love with Blake, despite his age, and wants him to take her to the prom.  
C: Because Blake is acting like he's her father, which is a sensitive topic for Deirdre because she lost her real parents. 
D: Because the young man gave up his right arm in order to afford tickets to the prom, and this disgusts Deirdre.

### REAL QUESTION — ANSWER THIS ONLY ###
Passage:
I, Antichrist? 

         Early one shiny autumn morning, I got in my car and drove to Lynchburg, Va., in order to find out whether or not I am the Antichrist. You know: the Beast, the Worthless Shepherd, the Little Horn, the Abomination, the linchpin of the Diabolical Trinity. That Antichrist. 

         I had my suspicions. Nowhere on my body could I find the mark of the Beast--666--but I do have a freckle that's shaped like Bermuda. And though I have never been seized by a desire to lead the armies of Satan in a final, bloody confrontation with the forces of God on the plain of Armageddon, I do suffer from aggravated dyspepsia, as well as chronic malaise, conditions that I'm sure afflict the Antichrist. 

         The surest suspicion I had about my pivotal role in Christian eschatology grew from the fact that I am Jewish, male, and alive. These are the qualifications for the job of Antichrist as specified by Lynchburg's most famous preacher, Jerry Falwell, in a speech he made earlier this year. 

         I was actually going to see the Rev. Falwell on a different matter, the future of Jerusalem, but I thought I might just slip this question--the one about me maybe being the Antichrist--into the stream of the interview. Falwell, I guessed, wouldn't be happy to discuss his views on the identity of the Antichrist--he had apologized for the remark but took quite a load of grief for it anyway. 

         As it turned out, though, Falwell was eager to talk about the Antichrist

Question:
What is the tone of the article?

Options:
A: cheerful
B: anxious

I, Antichrist? 

         Early one shiny autumn morning, I got in my car and drove to Lynchburg, Va., in order to find out whether or not I am the Antichrist. You know: the Beast, the Worthless Shepherd, the Little Horn, the Abomination, the linchpin of the Diabolical Trinity. That Antichrist. 

         I had my suspicions. Nowhere on my body could I find the mark of the Beast--666--but I do have a freckle that's shaped like Bermuda. And though I have never been seized by a desire to lead the armies of Satan in a final, bloody confrontation with the forces of God on the plain of Armageddon, I do suffer from aggravated dyspepsia, as well as chronic malaise, conditions that I'm sure afflict the Antichrist. 

         The surest suspicion I had about my pivotal role in Christian eschatology grew from the fact that I am Jewish, male, and alive. These are the qualifications for the job of Antichrist as specified by Lynchburg's most famous preacher, Jerry Falwell, in a speech he made earlier this year. 

         I was actually going to see the Rev. Falwell on a different matter, the future of Jerusalem, but I thought I might just slip this question--the one about me maybe being the Antichrist--into the stream of the interview. Falwell, I guessed, wouldn't be happy to discuss his views on the identity of the Antichrist--he had apologized for the remark but took quite a load of grief for it anyway. 

         As it turned out, though, Falwell was eager to talk about the Antichrist

Question:

There is nothing at all like having a sound
 
mind in a sound body, but Dan Merrol had too
 
much of one—and also too much of the other!
"Sorry, darling," said Erica. She yawned, added, "I've tried—but I
 just can't believe you're my husband."


 He felt his own yawn slip off his face. "What do you mean? What am I
 doing here then?"


 "Can't you remember?" Her laughter tinkled as she pushed him away and
 sat up. "They said you were Dan Merrol at the hospital, but they must
 have been wrong."


 "Hospitals don't make that kind of mistake," he said with a certainty
 he didn't altogether feel.


 "But
I
should know, shouldn't I?"


 "Of course, but...." He did some verbal backstepping. "It was a
 bad accident. You've got to expect that I won't be quite the same
 at first." He sat up. "
Look
at me. Can't you tell who I am?" She
 returned his gaze, then swayed toward him. He decided that she was
 highly attractive—but surely he ought to have known that long ago.
With a visible effort she leaned away from him. "Your left eye does
 look familiar," she said cautiously. "The brown one, I mean."


 "The
brown
one?"


 "Your other eye's green," she told him.


 "Of course—a replacement. I told you it was a serious accident.

THE GIRL IN HIS MIND
By ROBERT F. YOUNG


 [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from

 Worlds of Tomorrow April 1963

 Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that

Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of
 love and lust

Question:

There is nothing at all like having a sound
 
mind in a sound body, but Dan Merrol had too
 
much of one—and also too much of the other!
"Sorry, darling," said Erica. She yawned, added, "I've tried—but I
 just can't believe you're my husband."


 He felt his own yawn slip off his face. "What do you mean? What am I
 doing here then?"


 "Can't you remember?" Her laughter tinkled as she pushed him away and
 sat up. "They said you were Dan Merrol at the hospital, but they must
 have been wrong."


 "Hospitals don't make that kind of mistake," he said with a certainty
 he didn't altogether feel.


 "But
I
should know, shouldn't I?"


 "Of course, but...." He did some verbal backstepping. "It was a
 bad accident. You've got to expect that I won't be quite the same
 at first." He sat up. "
Look
at me. Can't you tell who I am?" She
 returned his gaze, then swayed toward him. He decided that she was
 highly attractive—but surely he ought to have known that long ago.
With a visible effort she leaned away from him. "Your left eye does

 "The

 "Your other eye's green," she told him.

Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of

There is nothing at all like having a sound
 
mind in a sound body, but Dan Merrol had too
 
much of one—and also too much of the other!
"Sorry, darling," said Erica. She yawned, added, "I've tried—but I
 just can't believe you're my husband."


 He felt his own yawn slip off his face. "What do you mean? What am I
 doing here then?"


 "Can't you remember?" Her laughter tinkled as she pushed him away and
 sat up. "They said you were Dan Merrol at the hospital, but they must
 have been wrong."


 "Hospitals don't make that kind of mistake," he said with a certainty
 he didn't altogether feel.


 "But
I
should know, shouldn't I?"


 "Of course, but...." He did some verbal backstepping. "It was a
 bad accident. You've got to expect that I won't be quite the same
 at first." He sat up. "
Look
at me. Can't you tell who I am?" She
 returned his gaze, then swayed toward him. He decided that she was
 highly attractive—but surely he ought to have known that long ago.
With a visible effort she leaned away from him. "Your left eye does
 look familiar," she said cautiously. "The brown one, I mean."


 "The
brown
one?"


 "Your other eye's green," she told him.


 "Of course—a replacement. I told you it was a serious accident. 

Question:
Does Dan Merrol want to make it work with Erica?

Options:
A: Yes, Dan knows that no one else will love him
B: Yes, she seems to Dan to be an excellent wife
C: No, he wants to have an open mind to other women
D: No, he wants to hide his appearance from everyone

Passage:
THE GIRL IN HIS MIND
By ROBERT F. YOUNG


 [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from

 Worlds of Tomorrow April 1963

 Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that

 the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]
Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of
 love and lust

Question:

B: 10 hours

There is nothing at all like having a sound
 
mind in a sound body, but Dan Merrol had too
 
much of one—and also too much of the other!
"Sorry, darling," said Erica. She yawned, added, "I've tried—but I
 just can't believe you're my husband."


 He felt his own yawn slip off his face. "What do you mean? What am I
 doing here then?"


 "Can't you remember?" Her laughter tinkled as she pushed him away and
 sat up. "They said you were Dan Merrol at the hospital, but they must
 have been wrong."


 "Hospitals don't make that kind of mistake," he said with a certainty
 he didn't altogether feel.


 "But
I
should know, shouldn't I?"


 "Of course, but...." He did some verbal backstepping. "It was a
 bad accident. You've got to expect that I won't be quite the same
 at first." He sat up. "
Look
at me. Can't you tell who I am?" She
 returned his gaze, then swayed toward him. He decided that she was
 highly attractive—but surely he ought to have known that long ago.
With a visible effort she leaned away from him. "Your left eye does
 look familiar," she said cautiously. "The brown one, I mean."


 "The
brown
one?"


 "Your other eye's green," she told him.


 "Of course—a replacement. I told you it was a serious accident.

Passage:
THE GIRL IN HIS MIND
By ROBERT F. YOUNG


 [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from

 Worlds of Tomorrow April 1963

 Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that

 the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]
Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of
 love and lust

Question:
How much time has passed between Blake's night with Eldoria and his search for Sabrina York in his mind-world?

Options:
A: 7 years
B: 10 hours
C: 12 years
D: 1 hour

Correct Answer: B

 Illustrated by ASHMAN


 [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from

There is nothing at all like having a sound
 
mind in a sound body, but Dan Merrol had too
 
much of one—and also too much of the other!
"Sorry, darling," said Erica. She yawned, added, "I've tried—but I
 just can't believe you're my husband."


 He felt his own yawn slip off his face. "What do you mean? What am I
 doing here then?"


 "Can't you remember?" Her laughter tinkled as she pushed him away and
 sat up. "They said you were Dan Merrol at the hospital, but they must
 have been wrong."


 "Hospitals don't make that kind of mistake," he said with a certainty
 he didn't altogether feel.


 "But
I
should know, shouldn't I?"


 "Of course, but...." He did some verbal backstepping. "It was a
 bad accident. You've got to expect that I won't be quite the same
 at first." He sat up. "
Look
at me. Can't you tell who I am?" She
 returned his gaze, then swayed toward him. He decided that she was
 highly attractive—but surely he ought to have known that long ago.
With a visible effort she leaned away from him. "Your left eye does
 look familiar," she said cautiously. "The brown one, I mean."


 "The
brown
one?"


 "Your other eye's green," she told him.


 "Of course—a replacement. I told you it was a serious accident. 

Question:
What would have happened if Dan had stayed in the hospital until he was discharged?

Options:
A: They would have replaced the mismatched limbs
B: They were never going to discharge him
C: They could have proven Wysocki's theorem
D: The would have helped both Dan and Erica understand the situation

mind in a sound body, but Dan Merrol had too
 
much of one—and also too much of the other!
"Sorry, darling," said Erica. She yawned, added, "I've tried—but I
 just can't believe you're my husband."


 He felt his own yawn slip off his face. "What do you mean? What am I

 "Can't you remember?" Her laughter tinkled as she pushed him away and
 sat up. "They said you were Dan Merrol at the hospital, but they must

 at first." He sat up. "

 returned his gaze, then swayed toward him. He decided that she was
 highly attractive—but surely he ought to have known that long ago.

 "Of course—a replacement. I told you it was a serious accident.

THE GIRL IN HIS MIND
By ROBERT F. YOUNG


 [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from

 Worlds of Tomorrow April 1963

 Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that

Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of
 love and lust

 "Can't you remember?" Her laughter tinkled as she pushed him away and

 "Hospitals don't make that kind of mistake," he said with a certainty

What am I\n doing here then?\"\n\n\n \"Can't you remember?\" Her laughter tinkled as she pushed him away and\n sat up. \"They said you were Dan Merrol at the hospital, but they must\n have been wrong.\"\n\n\n \"Hospitals don't make that kind of mistake,\" he said with a certainty\n he didn't altogether feel.\n\n\n \"But\nI\nshould know, shouldn't I?\"\n\n\n \"Of course, but....\" He did some verbal backstepping. \"It was a\n bad accident. You've got to expect that I won't be quite the same\n at first.\" He sat up. \"\nLook\nat me. Can't you tell who I am?\" She\n returned his gaze, then swayed toward him. He decided that she was\n highly attractive—but surely he ought to have known that long ago.\nWith a visible effort she leaned away from him. \"Your left eye does\n look familiar,\" she said cautiously. \"The brown one, I mean.\"\n\n\n \"The\nbrown\none?\"\n\n\n \"Your other eye's green,\" she told him.\n\n\n \"Of course—a replacement.

Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted

 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of

Every man's mind is a universe with countless

THE GIRL IN HIS MIND
By ROBERT F. YOUNG


 [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from

 Worlds of Tomorrow April 1963

 Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that

 the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]
Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of
 love and lust

Question:
How much time has passed between Blake's night with Eldoria and his search for Sabrina York in his mind-world?

Options:
A: 7 years
B: 10 hours

Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted

 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of

Dark Side Lite 

         Those poor souls who've been camping out in front of theaters for six weeks: Who can blame them for saying, "To hell with the critics, we know it will be great!"? The doors will open, and they'll race to grab the best seats and feel a surge of triumph as their butts sink down. We've made it: Yeeehaww!! They'll cheer when the familiar John Williams fanfare erupts and the title-- Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace --rises out of the screen and the backward-slanted opening "crawl" begins: "A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away ..." Yaaahhhhhhh!!! Then, their hearts pounding, they'll settle back to read the rest of the titles: "Turmoil has engulfed the Galactic Republic. The taxation of trade routes to outlying star systems is in dispute." Taxation of trade routes: Waaahoooo!!!!              

         How long will they go with it? At what point will they realize that what they've heard is, alas, true, that the picture really is a stiff? Maybe they never will. Maybe they'll want to love The

The doors will open, and they'll race to grab the best seats and feel a surge of triumph as their butts sink down. We've made it: Yeeehaww!! They'll cheer when the familiar John Williams fanfare erupts and the title-- Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace --rises out of the screen and the backward-slanted opening \"crawl\" begins: \"A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away ...\" Yaaahhhhhhh!!! Then, their hearts pounding, they'll settle back to read the rest of the titles: \"Turmoil has engulfed the Galactic Republic. The taxation of trade routes to outlying star systems is in dispute.\" Taxation of trade routes: Waaahoooo!!!!              \n\n         How long will they go with it? At what point will they realize that what they've heard is, alas, true, that the picture really is a stiff? Maybe they never will. Maybe they'll want to love The \n\n            Phantom Menace so much--because they have so much emotional energy invested in loving it, and in buying the books, magazines, dolls, cards, clothes, soap, fast food, etc.--that the realization will never sink in. In successful hypnosis, the subject works to enter a state of heightened susceptibility, to surrender to a higher power. Maybe they'll conclude that common sense is the enemy of the Force and fight it to the death. \n\n         Look, I w\n\nQuestion:\nWhat missing component of the movie does the critic reference throughout the entire review?\n\nOptions:\nA: Emotion\nB: Action\nC: Plot\nD: The Force\n\n\nYour Answer:", "role": "user", "name": null, "raw": false}], "model": "rwkv", "stream": false, "stop": ["\n\nUser", "\n\nQuestion", "\n\nQ", "\n\nHuman", "\n\nBob", "\n\nAssistant", "\n\nAnswer", "\n\nA", "\n\nBot", "\n\nAlice", "\n\nObservation", "\n\nUser", "\n\nAss"], "tools": null, "tool_choice": "auto", "user_name": null, "assistant_name": null, "system_name": null, "presystem": false}

Defining Decay Down

Second, be grateful that you have avoided the "intra-oral camera."

All this can be fixed, of course, with 10 grand of straightening, filling, sealing, and whitening.

Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of
 love and lust

Question:
Why does Deirdre get so upset when Blake Past suggests she go to prom with the young man?

Options:
A: Because Blake is trying to guilt Deirdre into going with the young man by telling her that it'll ease her conscience. 
B: Because Deirdre has fallen in love with Blake, despite his age, and wants him to take her to the prom.  
C: Because Blake is acting like he's her father, which is a sensitive topic for Deirdre because she lost her real parents. 
D: Because the young man gave up his right arm in order to afford tickets to the prom, and this disgusts Deirdre.

### REAL QUESTION — ANSWER THIS ONLY ###
Passage:
Defining Decay Down 

         If you haven't visited a dentist in the past few years, first of all, that's gross. (Checkups are every six months, and don't pretend you forgot.) Second, be grateful that you have avoided the "intra-oral camera." As the dentist (or assistant) navigates this horrifying little gadget through the graveyard of your mouth, a color television magnifies the florid pustulance of your gums and the puke-yellow dinge of your smile. A harmless crevice in your silver-mercury amalgam filling looks like Hell's Canyon. The microcracks in your enamel look like a broken window. All this can be fixed, of course, with 10 grand of straightening, filling, sealing, and whitening. "You will agree to anything the second they put that thing in your mouth," says one recent victim of the camera. "You can't believe you are walking around with that, that, that ick in your mouth." 

         The transformation of American dentistry from drill-and-fill to shoot-and-loot is an unlikely business success story of the '90s, a case study in how a profession can work itself out of a job and still prosper. Dentists, after all, are supposed to be extinct by now. While they happily (and profitably) scraped teeth and filled cavities during the '60s and '70s, fluoride was quietly choking off their revenue stream. The percentage of children with cavities fell by half and kept falling. People stopped going to the dentist, because they didn't need to. At the same time, the government funde

Question:
Why are people less satisfied with their smile now than in previous generations?

Options:
A: People had nicer smiles in the past
B: Plastic implants are not as effective as amalgam fillings
C: They aren't

The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated

Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of
 love and lust

Options:
A: He is embarrassed at the thought that Deirdre might enter the room while he is sleeping with Eldoria. 
B: He feels that prostitution is morally reprehensible. 
C: He feels guilty about sleeping with Eldoria when there's a child in the hut, Deirdre, who knows exactly what's going on. 
D: He feels guilty about wishing Deirdre was older so he could sleep with her instead.

### REAL QUESTION — ANSWER THIS ONLY ###
Passage:
Defining Decay Down 

         If you haven't visited a dentist in the past few years, first of all, that's gross. (Checkups are every six months, and don't pretend you forgot.) Second, be grateful that you have avoided the "intra-oral camera." As the dentist (or assistant) navigates this horrifying little gadget through the graveyard of your mouth, a color television magnifies the florid pustulance of your gums and the puke-yellow dinge of your smile. A harmless crevice in your silver-mercury amalgam filling looks like Hell's Canyon. The microcracks in your enamel look like a broken window. All this can be fixed, of course, with 10 grand of straightening, filling, sealing, and whitening. "You will agree to anything the second they put that thing in your mouth," says one recent victim of the camera. "You can't believe you are walking around with that, that, that ick in your mouth." 

         The transformation of American dentistry from drill-and-fill to shoot-and-loot is an unlikely business success story of the '90s, a case study in how a profession can work itself out of a job and still prosper. Dentists, after all, are supposed to be extinct by now. While they happily (and profitably) scraped teeth and filled cavities during the '60s and '70s, fluoride was quietly choking off their revenue stream. The percentage of children with cavities fell by half and kept falling. People stopped going to the dentist, because they didn't need to. At the same time, the government funde

Here's what happens when two Master
 
Spies tangle ... and stay that way!
"Nothing, nothing to get upset about," Pashkov said soothingly, taking
 his friend's arm as they came out of the villa forty miles from Moscow.
 Pashkov looked like a roly-poly zoo attendant leading a tame bear.
 "Erase his memory, give him a new name and feed him more patriotism.
 Very simple."


 Medvedev raised his hand threateningly. "Don't come howling to me if
 everybody guesses he is nothing but a robot."


 Pashkov glanced back at the house. Since the publication of
Dentist
 Amigovitch
, this house had become known all over the world as Boris
 Knackenpast's villa. Now the house was guarded by a company of
 soldiers to keep visitors out. From an open window Pashkov heard the
 clicking of a typewriter.


 "It's when they're not like robots that everybody suspects them," he
 said, climbing into his flier. "Petchareff will send you word when to
 announce his 'death'."


 "A question, brother."


 "No questions."


 "Who smuggled the manuscript out of Russia?"


 Pashkov frowned convincingly. "Comrade Petchareff has suspected even

 He took off for Moscow, poking his flier up through the clouds and

Every man's mind is a universe with countless

Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated

 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the

 Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that

 the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]
Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of
 love and lust

 Medvedev raised his hand threateningly. "Don't come howling to me if

Passage:
THE GIRL IN HIS MIND
By ROBERT F. YOUNG


 [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from

 Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that

 the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]
Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of
 love and lust

Question:
How much time has passed between Blake's night with Eldoria and his search for Sabrina York in his mind-world?

Options:
A: 7 years
B: 10 hours
C: 12 years
D: 1 hour

Here's what happens when two Master
 
Spies tangle ... and stay that way!
"Nothing, nothing to get upset about," Pashkov said soothingly, taking
 his friend's arm as they came out of the villa forty miles from Moscow.
 Pashkov looked like a roly-poly zoo attendant leading a tame bear.
 "Erase his memory, give him a new name and feed him more patriotism.
 Very simple."


 Medvedev raised his hand threateningly. "Don't come howling to me if
 everybody guesses he is nothing but a robot."


 Pashkov glanced back at the house. Since the publication of
Dentist
 Amigovitch
, this house had become known all over the world as Boris
 Knackenpast's villa. Now the house was guarded by a company of
 soldiers to keep visitors out. From an open window Pashkov heard the
 clicking of a typewriter.


 "It's when they're not like robots that everybody suspects them," he
 said, climbing into his flier. "Petchareff will send you word when to
 announce his 'death'."


 "A question, brother."


 "No questions."


 "Who smuggled the manuscript out of Russia?"


 Pashkov frowned convincingly. "Comrade Petchareff has suspected even
 me."


 He took off for Moscow, poking his flier up through the clouds and
 flying close to them, as was his habit. Then h

Question:

Every man's mind is a universe with countless

Every boy should be able to whistle, except,
 
of course, Martians. But this one did!
He seemed a very little boy to be carrying so large a butterfly net. He
 swung it in his chubby right fist as he walked, and at first glance you
 couldn't be sure if he were carrying it, or it carrying
him
.


 He came whistling. All little boys whistle. To little boys, whistling
 is as natural as breathing. However, there was something peculiar about
 this particular little boy's whistling. Or, rather, there were two
 things peculiar, but each was related to the other.


 The first was that he was a Martian little boy. You could be very sure
 of that, for Earth little boys have earlobes while Martian little boys
 do not—and he most certainly didn't.


 The second was the tune he whistled—a somehow familiar tune, but one
 which I should have thought not very appealing to a little boy.


 "Hi, there," I said when he came near enough. "What's that you're
 whistling?"


 He stopped whistling and he stopped walking, both at the same time, as
 though he had pulled a switch or turned a tap that shut them off. Then
 he lifted his little head and stared up into my eyes.


 "'The Calm'," he said in a sober, little-boy voice.

Every boy should be able to whistle, except,
 
of course, Martians. But this one did!
He seemed a very little boy to be carrying so large a butterfly net. He
 swung it in his chubby right fist as he walked, and at first glance you

Every man's mind is a universe with countless

The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted

He seemed a very little boy to be carrying so large a butterfly net. He

 He came whistling. All little boys whistle. To little boys, whistling
 is as natural as breathing. However, there was something peculiar about
 this particular little boy's whistling. Or, rather, there were two

 which I should have thought not very appealing to a little boy.


 "Hi, there," I said when he came near enough. "What's that you're

 He stopped whistling and he stopped walking, both at the same time, as

He seemed a very little boy to be carrying so large a butterfly net. He
 swung it in his chubby right fist as he walked, and at first glance you
 couldn't be sure if he were carrying it, or it carrying

 He came whistling. All little boys whistle. To little boys, whistling
 is as natural as breathing. However, there was something peculiar about
 this particular little boy's whistling. Or, rather, there were two
 things peculiar, but each was related to the other.


 The first was that he was a Martian little boy. You could be very sure
 of that, for Earth little boys have earlobes while Martian little boys
 do not—and he most certainly didn't.


 The second was the tune he whistled—a somehow familiar tune, but one
 which I should have thought not very appealing to a little boy.


 "Hi, there," I said when he came near enough. "What's that you're
 whistling?"


 He stopped whistling and he stopped walking, both at the same time, as
 though he had pulled a switch or turned a tap that shut them off. Then
 he lifted his little head and stared up into my eyes.

Every boy should be able to whistle, except,
 
of course, Martians. But this one did!
He seemed a very little boy to be carrying so large a butterfly net. He
 swung it in his chubby right fist as he walked, and at first glance you

 He came whistling. All little boys whistle. To little boys, whistling

 which I should have thought not very appealing to a little boy.


 "Hi, there," I said when he came near enough. "What's that you're
 whistling?"


 He stopped whistling and he stopped walking, both at the same time, as

 he lifted his little head and stared up into my eyes.

Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the

Every boy should be able to whistle, except,
 
of course, Martians. But this one did!
He seemed a very little boy to be carrying so large a butterfly net. He
 swung it in his chubby right fist as he walked, and at first glance you
 couldn't be sure if he were carrying it, or it carrying
him
.


 He came whistling. All little boys whistle. To little boys, whistling
 is as natural as breathing. However, there was something peculiar about
 this particular little boy's whistling. Or, rather, there were two
 things peculiar, but each was related to the other.


 The first was that he was a Martian little boy. You could be very sure
 of that, for Earth little boys have earlobes while Martian little boys
 do not—and he most certainly didn't.


 The second was the tune he whistled—a somehow familiar tune, but one
 which I should have thought not very appealing to a little boy.


 "Hi, there," I said when he came near enough. "What's that you're
 whistling?"


 He stopped whistling and he stopped walking, both at the same time, as
 though he had pulled a switch or turned a tap that shut them off. Then
 he lifted his little head and stared up into my eyes.


 "'The Calm'," he said in a sober, little-boy voice.

Perhaps \\"broadly\\" is putting too fine a point on it. The first hour, in which Arthur Sullivan (Allan Corduner) attempts to sever his ties with W.S. Gilbert (Jim Broadbent) and the owner of the Savoy, Richard D\'Oyly Carte (Ron Cook), is a mess: The order of scenes feels arbitrary, and characters pop up and vanish with bewildering frequency. You might be tempted to vanish, too. (Friends of mine did.) Be patient. Leigh\'s movies, born of actors\' improvisations and loosely shaped, always take a while to find their rhythm--and, frequently, their point. This one finds everything. By the end of its two hours and 40 minutes, Topsy-Turvy has evolved into something extraordinary: a monument to process--to the minutiae of making art. And to something more: the fundamental sadness of people who labor to make beautiful things--who soar--and then come down to a not-so-beautiful earth. \\n\\n         It would be charitable to attribute the shapelessness of the early scenes to the characters\' own lack of focus, but it would also be inane.

Passage:
THE GIRL IN HIS MIND
By ROBERT F. YOUNG


 [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from

 Worlds of Tomorrow April 1963

 Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that

 the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]
Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of
 love and lust

Question:
How much time has passed between Blake's night with Eldoria and his search for Sabrina York in his mind-world?

Options:
A: 7 years
B: 10 hours
C: 12 years
D: 1 hour

Options:
A: Because Blake is trying to guilt Deirdre into going with the young man by telling her that it'll ease her conscience. 
B: Because Deirdre has fallen in love with Blake, despite his age, and wants him to take her to the prom.  
C: Because Blake is acting like he's her father, which is a sensitive topic for Deirdre because she lost her real parents. 
D: Because the young man gave up his right arm in order to afford tickets to the prom, and this disgusts Deirdre.

### REAL QUESTION — ANSWER THIS ONLY ###
Passage:
Grand Finale 

         Mike Leigh's 

               Topsy-Turvy                 broadly recounts the creation of Gilbert and Sullivan's comic opera The Mikado at London's Savoy Theatre in 1885. Perhaps "broadly" is putting too fine a point on it. The first hour, in which Arthur Sullivan (Allan Corduner) attempts to sever his ties with W.S. Gilbert (Jim Broadbent) and the owner of the Savoy, Richard D'Oyly Carte (Ron Cook), is a mess: The order of scenes feels arbitrary, and characters pop up and vanish with bewildering frequency. You might be tempted to vanish, too. (Friends of mine did.) Be patient. Leigh's movies, born of actors' improvisations and loosely shaped, always take a while to find their rhythm--and, frequently, their point. This one finds everything. By the end of its two hours and 40 minutes, Topsy-Turvy has evolved into something extraordinary: a monument to process--to the minutiae of making art. And to something more: the fundamental sadness of people who labor to make beautiful things--who soar--and then come down to a not-so-beautiful earth. 

         It would be charitable to attribute the shapelessness of the early scenes to the characters' own lack of focus, but it would also be inane. As Elvis Mitchell pointed out in

Question:
Does the author think that Topsy-Turvy is a good movie?

### REAL QUESTION — ANSWER THIS ONLY ###
Passage:
Grand Finale 

         Mike Leigh's 

               Topsy-Turvy                 broadly recounts the creation of Gilbert and Sullivan's comic opera The Mikado at London's Savoy Theatre in 1885. Perhaps "broadly" is putting too fine a point on it. The first hour, in which Arthur Sullivan (Allan Corduner) attempts to sever his ties with W.S. Gilbert (Jim Broadbent) and the owner of the Savoy, Richard D'Oyly Carte (Ron Cook), is a mess: The order of scenes feels arbitrary, and characters pop up and vanish with bewildering frequency. You might be tempted to vanish, too. (Friends of mine did.) Be patient. Leigh's movies, born of actors' improvisations and loosely shaped, always take a while to find their rhythm--and, frequently, their point. This one finds everything. By the end of its two hours and 40 minutes, Topsy-Turvy has evolved into something extraordinary: a monument to process--to the minutiae of making art. And to something more: the fundamental sadness of people who labor to make beautiful things--who soar--and then come down to a not-so-beautiful earth. 

         It would be charitable to attribute the shapelessness of the early scenes to the characters' own lack of focus, but it would also be inane. As Elvis Mitchell pointed out in

Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was

THE GIRL IN HIS MIND
By ROBERT F. YOUNG

 Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that

Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of
 love and lust

               Topsy-Turvy                 broadly recounts the creation of Gilbert and Sullivan's comic opera The Mikado at London's Savoy Theatre in 1885. Perhaps "broadly" is putting too fine a point on it. The first hour, in which Arthur Sullivan (Allan Corduner) attempts to sever his ties with W.S.

### REAL QUESTION — ANSWER THIS ONLY ###
Passage:
Grand Finale 

         Mike Leigh's 

               Topsy-Turvy                 broadly recounts the creation of Gilbert and Sullivan's comic opera The Mikado at London's Savoy Theatre in 1885. Perhaps "broadly" is putting too fine a point on it. The first hour, in which Arthur Sullivan (Allan Corduner) attempts to sever his ties with W.S. Gilbert (Jim Broadbent) and the owner of the Savoy, Richard D'Oyly Carte (Ron Cook), is a mess: The order of scenes feels arbitrary, and characters pop up and vanish with bewildering frequency. You might be tempted to vanish, too. (Friends of mine did.) Be patient. Leigh's movies, born of actors' improvisations and loosely shaped, always take a while to find their rhythm--and, frequently, their point. This one finds everything. By the end of its two hours and 40 minutes, Topsy-Turvy has evolved into something extraordinary: a monument to process--to the minutiae of making art. And to something more: the fundamental sadness of people who labor to make beautiful things--who soar--and then come down to a not-so-beautiful earth. 

         It would be charitable to attribute the shapelessness of the early scenes to the characters' own lack of focus, but it would also be inane. As Elvis Mitchell pointed out in 

               Slate                's "," Leigh's opening shot features an usher who moves along a row of the Savoy Theatre lifting and peering under every seat. That's every seat. You can almost hear Leigh cackling: "How's this for a

Perhaps \"broadly\" is putting too fine a point on it. The first hour, in which Arthur Sullivan (Allan Corduner) attempts to sever his ties with W.S. Gilbert (Jim Broadbent) and the owner of the Savoy, Richard D'Oyly Carte (Ron Cook), is a mess: The order of scenes feels arbitrary, and characters pop up and vanish with bewildering frequency. You might be tempted to vanish, too. (Friends of mine did.) Be patient. Leigh's movies, born of actors' improvisations and loosely shaped, always take a while to find their rhythm--and, frequently, their point. This one finds everything. By the end of its two hours and 40 minutes, Topsy-Turvy has evolved into something extraordinary: a monument to process--to the minutiae of making art. And to something more: the fundamental sadness of people who labor to make beautiful things--who soar--and then come down to a not-so-beautiful earth. \n\n         It would be charitable to attribute the shapelessness of the early scenes to the characters' own lack of focus, but it would also be inane. As Elvis Mitchell pointed out in \n\n               Slate                's \",\" Leigh's opening shot features an usher who moves along a row of the Savoy Theatre lifting and peering under every seat. That's every seat.

Passage:
The Repairman
By Harry Harrison
Illustrated by Kramer
Being an interstellar trouble shooter wouldn’t be so bad …
 if I could shoot the trouble!


 The
 Old Man had that look of intense glee on his face that meant someone
 was in for a very rough time. Since we were alone, it took no great feat
 of intelligence to figure it would be me. I talked first, bold attack
 being the best defense and so forth.


 “I quit. Don’t bother telling me what dirty job you have
 cooked up, because I have already quit and you do not want to reveal
 company secrets to me.”


 The grin was even wider now and he actually chortled as he thumbed a
 button on his console. A thick legal document slid out of the delivery
 slot onto his desk.


 “This is your contract,” he said. “It tells how and
 when you will work. A steel-and-vanadium-bound contract that you
 couldn’t crack with a molecular disruptor.”


 I leaned out quickly, grabbed it and threw it into the air with a single
 motion. Before it could fall, I had my Solar out and, with a wide-angle
 shot, burned the contract to ashes.


 The Old Man pressed the button again and another contract slid out on
 his desk. If possible, the smile was still wider now.


 “I should have said a
 duplicate
 of your contract—like this
 one here.” He made a quick note on his secretary plate. “I
 have deducted 13 credits from your salary for the cost of the
 duplicate—as well as a 100-credit fine for firing a Solar inside a
 building.”

Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the

Passage:
The Repairman
By Harry Harrison
Illustrated by Kramer
Being an interstellar trouble shooter wouldn’t be so bad …
 if I could shoot the trouble!


 The
 Old Man had that look of intense glee on his face that meant someone
 was in for a very rough time. Since we were alone, it took no great feat

 The grin was even wider now and he actually chortled as he thumbed a
 button on his console. A thick legal document slid out of the delivery

 “I should have said a
 duplicate
 of your contract—like this
 one here.” He made a quick note on his secretary plate. “I
 have deducted 13 credits from your salary for the cost of the

 building.”


 I slumped, defeated, waiti

Passage:
THE GIRL IN HIS MIND
By ROBERT F. YOUNG


 [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from

 Worlds of Tomorrow April 1963

 Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that

 the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]
Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of
 love and lust

Question:
How much time has passed between Blake's night with Eldoria and his search for Sabrina York in his mind-world?

Options:
A: 7 years
B: 10 hours
C: 12 years
D: 1 hour

Passage:
The Repairman
By Harry Harrison
Illustrated by Kramer
Being an interstellar trouble shooter wouldn’t be so bad …
 if I could shoot the trouble!


 The
 Old Man had that look of intense glee on his face that meant someone
 was in for a very rough time. Since we were alone, it took no great feat
 of intelligence to figure it would be me. I talked first, bold attack
 being the best defense and so forth.


 “I quit. Don’t bother telling me what dirty job you have
 cooked up, because I have already quit and you do not want to reveal
 company secrets to me.”


 The grin was even wider now and he actually chortled as he thumbed a
 button on his console. A thick legal document slid out of the delivery
 slot onto his desk.


 “This is your contract,” he said. “It tells how and
 when you will work. A steel-and-vanadium-bound contract that you
 couldn’t crack with a molecular disruptor.”


 I leaned out quickly, grabbed it and threw it into the air with a single
 motion. Before it could fall, I had my Solar out and, with a wide-angle
 shot, burned the contract to ashes.


 The Old Man pressed the button again and another contract slid out on
 his desk. If possible, the smile was still wider now.


 “I should have said a
 duplicate
 of your contract—like this
 one here.” He made a quick note on his secretary plate. “I
 have deducted 13 credits from your salary for the cost of the
 duplicate—as well as a 100-credit fine for firing a Solar inside a
 building.”


 I slumped, defeated, waiti

 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of
 love and lust

Question:
Why does shame flame in Blake's cheeks when Deirdre goes to prepare Eldoria's dias?

Options:
A: He is embarrassed at the thought that Deirdre might enter the room while he is sleeping with Eldoria. 
B: He feels that prostitution is morally reprehensible. 
C: He feels guilty about sleeping with Eldoria when there's a child in the hut, Deirdre, who knows exactly what's going on. 
D: He feels guilty about wishing Deirdre was older so he could sleep with her instead. 

Correct Answer: C

### REAL QUESTION — ANSWER THIS ONLY ###
Passage:
The Repairman
By Harry Harrison
Illustrated by Kramer
Being an interstellar trouble shooter wouldn’t be so bad …
 if I could shoot the trouble!


 The
 Old Man had that look of intense glee on his face that meant someone
 was in for a very rough time. Since we were alone, it took no great feat
 of intelligence to figure it would be me. I talked first, bold attack
 being the best defense and so forth.


 “I quit. Don’t bother telling me what dirty job you have
 cooked up, because I have already quit and you do not want to reveal
 company secrets to me.”


 The grin was even wider now and he actually chortled as he thumbed a
 button on his console. A thick legal document slid out of the delivery
 slot onto his desk.


 “This is your contract,” he said. “It tells how and
 when you will work. A steel-and-vanadium-bound contract that you
 couldn’t crack with a molecular disruptor.”


 I leaned out quickly, grabbed it and threw it into the air with a single
 motion. Before it could fall, I had my Solar out and, with a wide-angle
 shot, burned the contract to ashes.


 The Old Man pressed the button again and another contract slid out on
 his desk. If possible, the smile was still wider now.


 “I should have said a
 duplicate
 of your contract—like this
 one here.” He made a quick note on his secretary plate. “I
 have deducted 13 credits from your salary for the cost of the
 duplicate—as well as a 100-credit fine for firing a Solar inside a
 building.”

Every man's mind is a universe with countless

The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted

Passage:
The Repairman
By Harry Harrison
Illustrated by Kramer
Being an interstellar trouble shooter wouldn’t be so bad …
 if I could shoot the trouble!


 The
 Old Man had that look of intense glee on his face that meant someone
 was in for a very rough time. Since we were alone, it took no great feat

 company secrets to me.”


 The grin was even wider now and he actually chortled as he thumbed a

 “I should have said a
 duplicate
 of your contract—like this
 one here.” He made a quick note on his secretary plate. “I
 have deducted 13 credits from your salary for the cost of the
 duplicate—as well as a 100-credit fine for firing a Solar inside a
 building.”


 I slumped, defeated, waiti

Passage:
The Repairman
By Harry Harrison
Illustrated by Kramer
Being an interstellar trouble shooter wouldn’t be so bad …
 if I could shoot the trouble!


 The
 Old Man had that look of intense glee on his face that meant someone
 was in for a very rough time. Since we were alone, it took no great feat
 of intelligence to figure it would be me. I talked first, bold attack
 being the best defense and so forth.


 “I quit. Don’t bother telling me what dirty job you have
 cooked up, because I have already quit and you do not want to reveal
 company secrets to me.”


 The grin was even wider now and he actually chortled as he thumbed a
 button on his console. A thick legal document slid out of the delivery
 slot onto his desk.


 “This is your contract,” he said. “It tells how and

 couldn’t crack with a molecular disruptor.”


 I leaned out quickly, grabbed it and threw it into the air with a single
 motion. Before it could fall, I had my Solar out and, with a wide-angle
 shot, burned the contract to ashes.


 The Old Man pressed the button again and another contract slid out on
 his desk. If possible, the smile was still wider now.


 “I should have said a
 duplicate
 of your contract—like this
 one here.” He made a quick note on his secretary plate. “I
 have deducted 13 credits from your salary for the cost of the
 duplicate—as well as a 100-credit fine for firing a Solar inside a
 building.”

Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the

 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."

Passage:
The Repairman
By Harry Harrison
Illustrated by Kramer
Being an interstellar trouble shooter wouldn’t be so bad …
 if I could shoot the trouble!


 The
 Old Man had that look of intense glee on his face that meant someone
 was in for a very rough time. Since we were alone, it took no great feat
 of intelligence to figure it would be me. I talked first, bold attack
 being the best defense and so forth.


 “I quit. Don’t bother telling me what dirty job you have
 cooked up, because I have already quit and you do not want to reveal
 company secrets to me.”


 The grin was even wider now and he actually chortled as he thumbed a
 button on his console. A thick legal document slid out of the delivery
 slot onto his desk.


 “This is your contract,” he said. “It tells how and
 when you will work. A steel-and-vanadium-bound contract that you
 couldn’t crack with a molecular disruptor.”


 I leaned out quickly, grabbed it and threw it into the air with a single

 “I should have said a
 duplicate
 of your contract—like this
 one here.” He made a quick note on his secretary plate. “I
 have deducted 13 credits from your salary for the cost of the
 duplicate—as well as a 100-credit fine for firing a Solar inside a
 building.”


 I slumped, defeated, waiti

THE HILLS OF HOME

 by Alfred Coppel
“Normality” is a myth; we're all a little neurotic, and the

 It wasn’t the Russian River. It was the Sacred Iss. The sun had touched
 the gem-encrusted cliffs by the shores of the Lost Sea of Korus and had
 vanished, leaving only the stillness of the dusk and the lonely cry of
 shore birds.


 From downstream came the faint sounds of music. It might have been a

 Kimmy shifted the heavy Martian pistol into his left hand and checked
 his harness. A soft smile touched his lips. He was well armed; there was
 nothing he had to fear from the Plant Men. His bare feet turned

A: He refused to pilot a rocket
B: His blond hair and pale skin

Passage:
[115]
THE HILLS OF HOME

 by Alfred Coppel
“Normality” is a myth; we're all a little neurotic, and the
 study of neurosis has been able to classify the general types of
 disturbance which are most common. And some types (providing the subject
 is not suffering so extreme a case as to have crossed the border into
 psychosis) can be not only useful, but perhaps necessary for certain
 kinds of work....
The river ran still and deep, green and gray in the eddies with the
 warm smell of late summer rising out of the slow water. Madrone and
 birch and willow, limp in the evening quiet, and the taste of
 smouldering leaves....


 It wasn’t the Russian River. It was the Sacred Iss. The sun had touched
 the gem-encrusted cliffs by the shores of the Lost Sea of Korus and had
 vanished, leaving only the stillness of the dusk and the lonely cry of
 shore birds.


 From downstream came the faint sounds of music. It might have been a
 phonograph playing in one of the summer cabins with names like Polly Ann
 Roost and Patches and Seventh Heaven, but to Kimmy it was the hated cry
 of the Father of Therns calling the dreadful Plant Men to their feast of
 victims borne into
 [116]
 this Valley Dor by the mysterious Iss.


 Kimmy shifted the heavy Martian pistol into his left hand and checked
 his harness. A soft smile touched his lips. He was well armed; there was
 nothing he had to fear from the Plant Men. His bare feet turned
 up-stream, away from the sound of the phonograph, toward the shall

Question:
What aspect of Kimmy's psychological state was beneficial to the long space flight?

Options:
A: His complete lack of anxiety
B: His antisocial behaviors
C: His tendency to dissociate into his own imagination
D: His extreme lethargy and patience

Passage:
[115]
THE HILLS OF HOME

 by Alfred Coppel
“Normality” is a myth; we're all a little neurotic, and the
 study of neurosis has been able to classify the general types of
 disturbance which are most common. And some types (providing the subject
 is not suffering so extreme a case as to have crossed the border into
 psychosis) can be not only useful, but perhaps necessary for certain
 kinds of work....
The river ran still and deep, green and gray in the eddies with the
 warm smell of late summer rising out of the slow water. Madrone and
 birch and willow, limp in the evening quiet, and the taste of
 smouldering leaves....


 It wasn’t the Russian River. It was the Sacred Iss. The sun had touched
 the gem-encrusted cliffs by the shores of the Lost Sea of Korus and had
 vanished, leaving only the stillness of the dusk and the lonely cry of
 shore birds.


 From downstream came the faint sounds of music. It might have been a
 phonograph playing in one of the summer cabins with names like Polly Ann
 Roost and Patches and Seventh Heaven, but to Kimmy it was the hated cry
 of the Father of Therns calling the dreadful Plant Men to their feast of
 victims borne into
 [116]
 this Valley Dor by the mysterious Iss.


 Kimmy shifted the heavy Martian pistol into his left hand and checked
 his harness. A soft smile touched his lips. He was well armed; there was
 nothing he had to fear from the Plant Men. His bare feet turned
 up-stream, away from the sound of the phonograph, toward the shall

Question:
What is an example given of Kimmy's schizophrenic tendencies?

Options:
A: He believed an old faucet was a radium pistol 
B: His questioning of the doctor's motives
C: His dreaming of his wife during the flight
D: He was imperceptive of time

Passage:
[115]
THE HILLS OF HOME

 by Alfred Coppel
“Normality” is a myth; we're all a little neurotic, and the
 study of neurosis has been able to classify the general types of
 disturbance which are most common. And some types (providing the subject
 is not suffering so extreme a case as to have crossed the border into
 psychosis) can be not only useful, but perhaps necessary for certain
 kinds of work....
The river ran still and deep, green and gray in the eddies with the
 warm smell of late summer rising out of the slow water. Madrone and
 birch and willow, limp in the evening quiet, and the taste of
 smouldering leaves....


 It wasn’t the Russian River. It was the Sacred Iss. The sun had touched
 the gem-encrusted cliffs by the shores of the Lost Sea of Korus and had
 vanished, leaving only the stillness of the dusk and the lonely cry of
 shore birds.


 From downstream came the faint sounds of music. It might have been a
 phonograph playing in one of the summer cabins with names like Polly Ann
 Roost and Patches and Seventh Heaven, but to Kimmy it was the hated cry
 of the Father of Therns calling the dreadful Plant Men to their feast of
 victims borne into
 [116]
 this Valley Dor by the mysterious Iss.


 Kimmy shifted the heavy Martian pistol into his left hand and checked
 his harness. A soft smile touched his lips. He was well armed; there was
 nothing he had to fear from the Plant Men. His bare feet turned
 up-stream, away from the sound of the phonograph, toward the shall

Question:
Where had Kimmy arrived after waking from his slumber in the ship?

Options:
A: Mars
B: Venus
C: Korus
D: Earth

Passage:
[115]
THE HILLS OF HOME

 by Alfred Coppel
“Normality” is a myth; we're all a little neurotic, and the
 study of neurosis has been able to classify the general types of
 disturbance which are most common. And some types (providing the subject
 is not suffering so extreme a case as to have crossed the border into
 psychosis) can be not only useful, but perhaps necessary for certain
 kinds of work....
The river ran still and deep, green and gray in the eddies with the
 warm smell of late summer rising out of the slow water. Madrone and
 birch and willow, limp in the evening quiet, and the taste of
 smouldering leaves....


 It wasn’t the Russian River. It was the Sacred Iss. The sun had touched
 the gem-encrusted cliffs by the shores of the Lost Sea of Korus and had
 vanished, leaving only the stillness of the dusk and the lonely cry of
 shore birds.


 From downstream came the faint sounds of music. It might have been a
 phonograph playing in one of the summer cabins with names like Polly Ann
 Roost and Patches and Seventh Heaven, but to Kimmy it was the hated cry
 of the Father of Therns calling the dreadful Plant Men to their feast of
 victims borne into
 [116]
 this Valley Dor by the mysterious Iss.


 Kimmy shifted the heavy Martian pistol into his left hand and checked
 his harness. A soft smile touched his lips. He was well armed; there was
 nothing he had to fear from the Plant Men. His bare feet turned
 up-stream, away from the sound of the phonograph, toward the shall

Question:
Where was the music from the phonograph coming from?

Options:
A: The bottom of the Valley Dor
B: Kimmy was imagining the music
C: Dr. Steinhart was playing it to study Kimmy's reaction
D: Matai Shang's house

Passage:
[115]
THE HILLS OF HOME

 by Alfred Coppel
“Normality” is a myth; we're all a little neurotic, and the
 study of neurosis has been able to classify the general types of
 disturbance which are most common. And some types (providing the subject
 is not suffering so extreme a case as to have crossed the border into
 psychosis) can be not only useful, but perhaps necessary for certain
 kinds of work....
The river ran still and deep, green and gray in the eddies with the
 warm smell of late summer rising out of the slow water. Madrone and
 birch and willow, limp in the evening quiet, and the taste of
 smouldering leaves....


 It wasn’t the Russian River. It was the Sacred Iss. The sun had touched
 the gem-encrusted cliffs by the shores of the Lost Sea of Korus and had
 vanished, leaving only the stillness of the dusk and the lonely cry of
 shore birds.


 From downstream came the faint sounds of music. It might have been a
 phonograph playing in one of the summer cabins with names like Polly Ann
 Roost and Patches and Seventh Heaven, but to Kimmy it was the hated cry
 of the Father of Therns calling the dreadful Plant Men to their feast of
 victims borne into
 [116]
 this Valley Dor by the mysterious Iss.


 Kimmy shifted the heavy Martian pistol into his left hand and checked
 his harness. A soft smile touched his lips. He was well armed; there was
 nothing he had to fear from the Plant Men. His bare feet turned
 up-stream, away from the sound of the phonograph, toward the shall

Question:
What is the significance of Kimmy's trip?

Options:
A: He will be the first man on Mars
B: He will be the first trip to space in two years
C: He will finally return home
D: He is going to defeat the Plant Men

Passage:
[115]
THE HILLS OF HOME

 by Alfred Coppel
“Normality” is a myth; we're all a little neurotic, and the
 study of neurosis has been able to classify the general types of
 disturbance which are most common. And some types (providing the subject
 is not suffering so extreme a case as to have crossed the border into
 psychosis) can be not only useful, but perhaps necessary for certain
 kinds of work....
The river ran still and deep, green and gray in the eddies with the
 warm smell of late summer rising out of the slow water. Madrone and
 birch and willow, limp in the evening quiet, and the taste of
 smouldering leaves....


 It wasn’t the Russian River. It was the Sacred Iss. The sun had touched
 the gem-encrusted cliffs by the shores of the Lost Sea of Korus and had
 vanished, leaving only the stillness of the dusk and the lonely cry of
 shore birds.


 From downstream came the faint sounds of music. It might have been a
 phonograph playing in one of the summer cabins with names like Polly Ann
 Roost and Patches and Seventh Heaven, but to Kimmy it was the hated cry
 of the Father of Therns calling the dreadful Plant Men to their feast of
 victims borne into
 [116]
 this Valley Dor by the mysterious Iss.


 Kimmy shifted the heavy Martian pistol into his left hand and checked
 his harness. A soft smile touched his lips. He was well armed; there was
 nothing he had to fear from the Plant Men. His bare feet turned
 up-stream, away from the sound of the phonograph, toward the shall

Question:
What did Kimmy realize that Steinhart was right about?

Options:
A: He did indeed escape reality with his overactive imagination
B: He was overjoyed to have made it to another planet
C: He did feel younger after the trip
D: He felt at home upon arriving

The Street That

 Wasn't There
by CLIFFORD D. SIMAK and CARL JACOBI
Mr. Jonathon Chambers left his house on Maple Street at exactly
 seven o'clock in the evening and set out on the daily walk he had
 taken, at the same time, come rain or snow, for twenty solid
 years.


 The walk never varied. He paced two blocks down Maple Street,
 stopped at the Red Star confectionery to buy a Rose Trofero
 perfecto, then walked to the end of the fourth block on Maple.
 There he turned right on Lexington, followed Lexington to Oak,
 down Oak and so by way of Lincoln back to Maple again and to his
 home.


 He didn't walk fast. He took his time. He always returned to his
 front door at exactly 7:45. No one ever stopped to talk with
 him. Even the man at the Red Star confectionery, where he bought
 his cigar, remained silent while the purchase was being made. Mr.
 Chambers merely tapped on the glass top of the counter with a
 coin, the man reached in and brought forth the box, and Mr.
 Chambers took his cigar. That was all.


 For people long ago had gathered that Mr. Chambers desired to be
 left alone. The newer generation of townsfolk called it
 eccentricity. Certain uncouth persons had a different word for
 it. The oldsters remembered that this queer looking individual

THE GIRL IN HIS MIND
By ROBERT F. YOUNG

Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of
 love and lust

Question:
How much time has passed between Blake's night with Eldoria and his search for Sabrina York in his mind-world?

A: 7 years
B: 10 hours

The Street That

 Wasn't There
by CLIFFORD D. SIMAK and CARL JACOBI
Mr. Jonathon Chambers left his house on Maple Street at exactly
 seven o'clock in the evening and set out on the daily walk he had
 taken, at the same time, come rain or snow, for twenty solid
 years.


 The walk never varied. He paced two blocks down Maple Street,
 stopped at the Red Star confectionery to buy a Rose Trofero
 perfecto, then walked to the end of the fourth block on Maple.
 There he turned right on Lexington, followed Lexington to Oak,
 down Oak and so by way of Lincoln back to Maple again and to his
 home.


 He didn't walk fast. He took his time. He always returned to his
 front door at exactly 7:45. No one ever stopped to talk with
 him. Even the man at the Red Star confectionery, where he bought
 his cigar, remained silent while the purchase was being made. Mr.
 Chambers merely tapped on the glass top of the counter with a
 coin, the man reached in and brought forth the box, and Mr.
 Chambers took his cigar. That was all.


 For people long ago had gathered that Mr. Chambers desired to be
 left alone. The newer generation of townsfolk called it
 eccentricity. Certain uncouth persons had a different word for
 it. The oldsters remembered that this queer looking individual

The Street That

 Wasn't There
by CLIFFORD D. SIMAK and CARL JACOBI
Mr. Jonathon Chambers left his house on Maple Street at exactly
 seven o'clock in the evening and set out on the daily walk he had
 taken, at the same time, come rain or snow, for twenty solid
 years.


 The walk never varied. He paced two blocks down Maple Street,
 stopped at the Red Star confectionery to buy a Rose Trofero
 perfecto, then walked to the end of the fourth block on Maple.
 There he turned right on Lexington, followed Lexington to Oak,
 down Oak and so by way of Lincoln back to Maple again and to his
 home.


 He didn't walk fast. He took his time. He always returned to his
 front door at exactly 7:45. No one ever stopped to talk with
 him. Even the man at the Red Star confectionery, where he bought
 his cigar, remained silent while the purchase was being made. Mr.
 Chambers merely tapped on the glass top of the counter with a
 coin, the man reached in and brought forth the box, and Mr.
 Chambers took his cigar. That was all.

Mr. Jonathon Chambers left his house on Maple Street at exactly
 seven o'clock in the evening and set out on the daily walk he had
 taken, at the same time, come rain or snow, for twenty solid

 his cigar, remained silent while the purchase was being made. Mr.

The Street That

 Wasn't There
by CLIFFORD D. SIMAK and CARL JACOBI
Mr. Jonathon Chambers left his house on Maple Street at exactly
 seven o'clock in the evening and set out on the daily walk he had
 taken, at the same time, come rain or snow, for twenty solid
 years.


 The walk never varied. He paced two blocks down Maple Street,
 stopped at the Red Star confectionery to buy a Rose Trofero
 perfecto, then walked to the end of the fourth block on Maple.
 There he turned right on Lexington, followed Lexington to Oak,
 down Oak and so by way of Lincoln back to Maple again and to his
 home.


 He didn't walk fast. He took his time. He always returned to his
 front door at exactly 7:45. No one ever stopped to talk with
 him. Even the man at the Red Star confectionery, where he bought
 his cigar, remained silent while the purchase was being made. Mr.
 Chambers merely tapped on the glass top of the counter with a
 coin, the man reached in and brought forth the box, and Mr.
 Chambers took his cigar. That was all.


 For people long ago had gathered that Mr. Chambers desired to be
 left alone. The newer generation of townsfolk called it
 eccentricity. Certain uncouth persons had a different word for
 it. The oldsters remembered that this queer looking individual

Question:
Why did Mr. Chambers think that man might be losing control over physical reality?

A: It was an inevitable function of time passing
B: The nuclear experiments of the time were tearing apart the threads of reality 
C: The loss of life from war and plague left too few of minds to retain control
D: The constant bickering left a lack of harmony

The Street That

by CLIFFORD D. SIMAK and CARL JACOBI
Mr. Jonathon Chambers left his house on Maple Street at exactly
 seven o'clock in the evening and set out on the daily walk he had
 taken, at the same time, come rain or snow, for twenty solid
 years.


 The walk never varied. He paced two blocks down Maple Street,
 stopped at the Red Star confectionery to buy a Rose Trofero
 perfecto, then walked to the end of the fourth block on Maple.
 There he turned right on Lexington, followed Lexington to Oak,
 down Oak and so by way of Lincoln back to Maple again and to his
 home.


 He didn't walk fast. He took his time. He always returned to his
 front door at exactly 7:45. No one ever stopped to talk with
 him. Even the man at the Red Star confectionery, where he bought
 his cigar, remained silent while the purchase was being made. Mr.
 Chambers merely tapped on the glass top of the counter with a
 coin, the man reached in and brought forth the box, and Mr.
 Chambers took his cigar. That was all.


 For people long ago had gathered that Mr. Chambers desired to be

The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted

The Street That

 Wasn't There
by CLIFFORD D. SIMAK and CARL JACOBI
Mr. Jonathon Chambers left his house on Maple Street at exactly
 seven o'clock in the evening and set out on the daily walk he had
 taken, at the same time, come rain or snow, for twenty solid
 years.


 The walk never varied. He paced two blocks down Maple Street,
 stopped at the Red Star confectionery to buy a Rose Trofero
 perfecto, then walked to the end of the fourth block on Maple.
 There he turned right on Lexington, followed Lexington to Oak,
 down Oak and so by way of Lincoln back to Maple again and to his
 home.


 He didn't walk fast. He took his time. He always returned to his
 front door at exactly 7:45. No one ever stopped to talk with
 him. Even the man at the Red Star confectionery, where he bought
 his cigar, remained silent while the purchase was being made. Mr.
 Chambers merely tapped on the glass top of the counter with a
 coin, the man reached in and brought forth the box, and Mr.
 Chambers took his cigar. That was all.


 For people long ago had gathered that Mr. Chambers desired to be
 left alone. The newer generation of townsfolk called it
 eccentricity. Certain uncouth persons had a different word for
 it. The oldsters remembered that this queer looking individual
 with his black silk muffler, rosewood cane and

Question:
Why might Mr. Chambers think that the face from his vision from "behind the curtain" is evil?

Options:
A: He saw it as a representation of the people who hated him
B: It was too large in scale for him to comprehend
C: It revealed its' evil intentions to Mr. Chambers directly 
D: He felt that this new presence was trying to steal reality from humans

He paced two blocks down Maple Street,\n stopped at the Red Star confectionery to buy a Rose Trofero\n perfecto, then walked to the end of the fourth block on Maple.\n There he turned right on Lexington, followed Lexington to Oak,\n down Oak and so by way of Lincoln back to Maple again and to his\n home.\n\n\n He didn't walk fast. He took his time. He always returned to his\n front door at exactly 7:45. No one ever stopped to talk with\n him. Even the man at the Red Star confectionery, where he bought\n his cigar, remained silent while the purchase was being made. Mr.\n Chambers merely tapped on the glass top of the counter with a\n coin, the man reached in and brought forth the box, and Mr.\n Chambers took his cigar. That was all.\n\n\n For people long ago had gathered that Mr. Chambers desired to be\n left alone. The newer generation of townsfolk called it\n eccentricity.

Passage:
[101]
EXILE
BY H. B. FYFE
ILLUSTRATED BY EMSH


 The Dome of Eyes made it almost impossible for
 Terrans to reach the world of Tepokt. For those
 who did land there, there was no returning—only
 the bitterness of respect—and justice!


 The Tepoktan student, whose
 blue robe in George Kinton's
 opinion clashed with the dull
 purple of his scales, twiddled a
 three-clawed hand for attention.
 Kinton nodded to him from his
 place on the dais before the
 group.


 "Then you can give us no precise
 count of the stars in the
 galaxy, George?"


 Kinton smiled wrily, and ran
 a wrinkled hand through his
 graying hair. In the clicking Tepoktan
 speech, his name came
 out more like "Chortch."


 Questions like this had been
 put to him often during the ten
 years since his rocket had
 hurtled through the meteorite
 belt and down to the surface of
 Tepokt, leaving him the only survivor.
 Barred off as they were
 from venturing into space, the
 highly civilized Tepoktans constantly
 displayed the curiosity of
 dreamers in matters related to
 the universe. Because of the veil
 of meteorites and satellite fragments
 whirling about their
 planet, their astronomers had acquired
 torturous skills but only
 scraps of real knowledge.


 "As I believe I mentioned in
 some of my recorded lectures,"
 Kinton answered in their language,
 [103]
 "the number is actually
 as vast as it seems to those of

 race have not yet encountered

Question:
Why were the Tepoktan's barred from going into space?

### REAL QUESTION — ANSWER THIS ONLY ###
Passage:
[101]
EXILE
BY H. B. FYFE
ILLUSTRATED BY EMSH


 The Dome of Eyes made it almost impossible for
 Terrans to reach the world of Tepokt. For those
 who did land there, there was no returning—only
 the bitterness of respect—and justice!


 The Tepoktan student, whose
 blue robe in George Kinton's
 opinion clashed with the dull
 purple of his scales, twiddled a
 three-clawed hand for attention.
 Kinton nodded to him from his
 place on the dais before the
 group.


 "Then you can give us no precise
 count of the stars in the
 galaxy, George?"


 Kinton smiled wrily, and ran
 a wrinkled hand through his
 graying hair. In the clicking Tepoktan
 speech, his name came
 out more like "Chortch."


 Questions like this had been
 put to him often during the ten
 years since his rocket had
 hurtled through the meteorite
 belt and down to the surface of
 Tepokt, leaving him the only survivor.
 Barred off as they were
 from venturing into space, the
 highly civilized Tepoktans constantly
 displayed the curiosity of
 dreamers in matters related to
 the universe. Because of the veil
 of meteorites and satellite fragments
 whirling about their
 planet, their astronomers had acquired
 torturous skills but only
 scraps of real knowledge.


 "As I believe I mentioned in
 some of my recorded lectures,"
 Kinton answered in their language,
 [103]
 "the number is actually
 as vast as it seems to those of
 you peering through the Dome
 of Eyes. The scientists of my
 race have not yet encountered

Question:
What is it implied when it is said that the survivor is "not what he was hoping for?"

Options:
A: George would have preferred the survivor to have been of a stronger build
B: George would have preferred the survivor to be uninjured
C: George would have preferred for the survivor to have been a woman
D: George would have wanted the survivor to not have been from Terra

Passage:
THE GIRL IN HIS MIND
By ROBERT F. YOUNG


 [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from

 Worlds of Tomorrow April 1963

 Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that

 the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]
Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of
 love and lust

Question:
How much time has passed between Blake's night with Eldoria and his search for Sabrina York in his mind-world?

Options:
A: 7 years
B: 10 hours
C: 12 years
D: 1 hour

Correct Answer: B

### REAL QUESTION — ANSWER THIS ONLY ###
Passage:
[101]
EXILE
BY H. B. FYFE
ILLUSTRATED BY EMSH


 The Dome of Eyes made it almost impossible for
 Terrans to reach the world of Tepokt. For those
 who did land there, there was no returning—only
 the bitterness of respect—and justice!


 The Tepoktan student, whose
 blue robe in George Kinton's
 opinion clashed with the dull
 purple of his scales, twiddled a
 three-clawed hand for attention.
 Kinton nodded to him from his
 place on the dais before the
 group.


 "Then you can give us no precise
 count of the stars in the
 galaxy, George?"


 Kinton smiled wrily, and ran
 a wrinkled hand through his
 graying hair. In the clicking Tepoktan
 speech, his name came
 out more like "Chortch."


 Questions like this had been
 put to him often during the ten
 years since his rocket had
 hurtled through the meteorite
 belt and down to the surface of
 Tepokt, leaving him the only survivor.
 Barred off as they were
 from venturing into space, the
 highly civilized Tepoktans constantly
 displayed the curiosity of
 dreamers in matters related to
 the universe. Because of the veil
 of meteorites and satellite fragments
 whirling about their
 planet, their astronomers had acquired
 torturous skills but only
 scraps of real knowledge.


 "As I believe I mentioned in
 some of my recorded lectures,"
 Kinton answered in their language,
 [103]
 "the number is actually
 as vast as it seems to those of
 you peering through the Dome
 of Eyes. The scientists of my
 race have not yet encountered

Question:
Why is the injured man surprised to see George? 

Options:
A: George is the only human on an alien planet
B: He is surprised to be alive and able to see
C: He knows George from a previous encounter
D: He was on a rescue mission for George

EXILE
BY H. B. FYFE
ILLUSTRATED BY EMSH


 The Dome of Eyes made it almost impossible for
 Terrans to reach the world of Tepokt. For those
 who did land there, there was no returning—only
 the bitterness of respect—and justice!


 The Tepoktan student, whose
 blue robe in George Kinton's
 opinion clashed with the dull
 purple of his scales, twiddled a
 three-clawed hand for attention.
 Kinton nodded to him from his
 place on the dais before the
 group.


 "Then you can give us no precise
 count of the stars in the
 galaxy, George?"


 Kinton smiled wrily, and ran
 a wrinkled hand through his
 graying hair. In the clicking Tepoktan
 speech, his name came
 out more like "Chortch."


 Questions like this had been
 put to him often during the ten
 years since his rocket had
 hurtled through the meteorite
 belt and down to the surface of
 Tepokt, leaving him the only survivor.
 Barred off as they were
 from venturing into space, the
 highly civilized Tepoktans constantly
 displayed the curiosity of
 dreamers in matters related to
 the universe. Because of the veil
 of meteorites and satellite fragments
 whirling about their
 planet, their astronomers had acquired
 torturous skills but only
 scraps of real knowledge.

Every man's mind is a universe with countless

[101]
EXILE
BY H. B. FYFE
ILLUSTRATED BY EMSH


 The Dome of Eyes made it almost impossible for
 Terrans to reach the world of Tepokt. For those
 who did land there, there was no returning—only
 the bitterness of respect—and justice!


 The Tepoktan student, whose
 blue robe in George Kinton's
 opinion clashed with the dull
 purple of his scales, twiddled a
 three-clawed hand for attention.
 Kinton nodded to him from his
 place on the dais before the
 group.


 "Then you can give us no precise
 count of the stars in the
 galaxy, George?"


 Kinton smiled wrily, and ran
 a wrinkled hand through his
 graying hair. In the clicking Tepoktan
 speech, his name came
 out more like "Chortch."


 Questions like this had been
 put to him often during the ten
 years since his rocket had
 hurtled through the meteorite
 belt and down to the surface of
 Tepokt, leaving him the only survivor.
 Barred off as they were
 from venturing into space, the
 highly civilized Tepoktans constantly
 displayed the curiosity of
 dreamers in matters related to
 the universe. Because of the veil
 of meteorites and satellite fragments
 whirling about their
 planet, their astronomers had acquired
 torturous skills but only
 scraps of real knowledge.


 "As I believe I mentioned in
 some of my recorded lectures,"
 Kinton answered in their language,

Passage:
[101]
EXILE
BY H. B. FYFE
ILLUSTRATED BY EMSH


 The Dome of Eyes made it almost impossible for
 Terrans to reach the world of Tepokt. For those
 who did land there, there was no returning—only
 the bitterness of respect—and justice!


 The Tepoktan student, whose
 blue robe in George Kinton's
 opinion clashed with the dull
 purple of his scales, twiddled a
 three-clawed hand for attention.
 Kinton nodded to him from his
 place on the dais before the
 group.


 "Then you can give us no precise
 count of the stars in the
 galaxy, George?"


 Kinton smiled wrily, and ran
 a wrinkled hand through his
 graying hair. In the clicking Tepoktan
 speech, his name came

 hurtled through the meteorite
 belt and down to the surface of
 Tepokt, leaving him the only survivor.

 whirling about their
 planet, their astronomers had acquired
 torturous skills but only
 scraps of real knowledge.


 "As I believe I mentioned in
 some of my recorded lectures,"
 Kinton answered in their language,

 "the number is actually
 as vast as it seems to those of

 race have not yet encountered

THE GIRL IN HIS MIND
By ROBERT F. YOUNG

 Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that

 the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]
Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of
 love and lust

Question:
How much time has passed between Blake's night with Eldoria and his search for Sabrina York in his mind-world?

Why does Deirdre get so upset when Blake Past suggests she go to prom with the young man?

Options:
A: Because Blake is trying to guilt Deirdre into going with the young man by telling her that it'll ease her conscience. 
B: Because Deirdre has fallen in love with Blake, despite his age, and wants him to take her to the prom.  
C: Because Blake is acting like he's her father, which is a sensitive topic for Deirdre because she lost her real parents. 
D: Because the young man gave up his right arm in order to afford tickets to the prom, and this disgusts Deirdre.

### REAL QUESTION — ANSWER THIS ONLY ###
Passage:
[101]
EXILE
BY H. B. FYFE
ILLUSTRATED BY EMSH


 The Dome of Eyes made it almost impossible for
 Terrans to reach the world of Tepokt. For those
 who did land there, there was no returning—only
 the bitterness of respect—and justice!


 The Tepoktan student, whose
 blue robe in George Kinton's
 opinion clashed with the dull
 purple of his scales, twiddled a
 three-clawed hand for attention.
 Kinton nodded to him from his
 place on the dais before the
 group.


 "Then you can give us no precise
 count of the stars in the
 galaxy, George?"


 Kinton smiled wrily, and ran
 a wrinkled hand through his
 graying hair. In the clicking Tepoktan
 speech, his name came
 out more like "Chortch."


 Questions like this had been
 put to him often during the ten
 years since his rocket had
 hurtled through the meteorite
 belt and down to the surface of
 Tepokt, leaving him the only survivor.
 Barred off as they were
 from venturing into space, the
 highly civilized Tepoktans constantly
 displayed the curiosity of
 dreamers in matters related to
 the universe. Because of the veil
 of meteorites and satellite fragments
 whirling about their
 planet, their astronomers had acquired
 torturous skills but only
 scraps of real knowledge.


 "As I believe I mentioned in
 some of my recorded lectures,"
 Kinton answered in their language,
 [103]
 "the number is actually
 as vast as it seems to those of
 you peering through the Dome
 of Eyes. The scientists of my
 race have not yet encountered
 any b

Question:
Why did George remain on Tepokt instead of returning home?

Options:
A: He like the way he was treated with respect on Tepokt
B: He was a wanted criminal on his home planet
C: He wanted to help the Tepoktans achieve interstellar travel
D: He was afraid of crashing in the meteorite field while leaving

Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the

The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated

Question:
Why does Deirdre get so upset when Blake Past suggests she go to prom with the young man?

Options:
A: Because Blake is trying to guilt Deirdre into going with the young man by telling her that it'll ease her conscience. 
B: Because Deirdre has fallen in love with Blake, despite his age, and wants him to take her to the prom.  
C: Because Blake is acting like he's her father, which is a sensitive topic for Deirdre because she lost her real parents. 
D: Because the young man gave up his right arm in order to afford tickets to the prom, and this disgusts Deirdre.

[101]
EXILE
BY H. B. FYFE
ILLUSTRATED BY EMSH


 The Dome of Eyes made it almost impossible for
 Terrans to reach the world of Tepokt. For those
 who did land there, there was no returning—only
 the bitterness of respect—and justice!


 The Tepoktan student, whose
 blue robe in George Kinton's
 opinion clashed with the dull
 purple of his scales, twiddled a
 three-clawed hand for attention.
 Kinton nodded to him from his
 place on the dais before the
 group.


 "Then you can give us no precise
 count of the stars in the
 galaxy, George?"


 Kinton smiled wrily, and ran
 a wrinkled hand through his
 graying hair. In the clicking Tepoktan
 speech, his name came
 out more like "Chortch."


 Questions like this had been
 put to him often during the ten
 years since his rocket had
 hurtled through the meteorite
 belt and down to the surface of
 Tepokt, leaving him the only survivor.
 Barred off as they were
 from venturing into space, the
 highly civilized Tepoktans constantly
 displayed the curiosity of
 dreamers in matters related to
 the universe. Because of the veil
 of meteorites and satellite fragments
 whirling about their
 planet, their astronomers had acquired
 torturous skills but only
 scraps of real knowledge.


 "As I believe I mentioned in
 some of my recorded lectures,"
 Kinton answered in their language,

Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of
 love and lust

### REAL QUESTION — ANSWER THIS ONLY ###
Passage:
SLINGSHOT
BY

 IRVING W. LANDE
Illustrated by Emsh
The slingshot
 was, I believe, one of the few
 weapons of history that wasn't used in the last war.
 That doesn't mean it won't be used in the next!
"Got a bogey at three o'clock high.
 Range about six hundred miles."
 Johnson spoke casually, but his voice
 in the intercom was thin with tension.


 Captain Paul Coulter, commanding
 Space Fighter 308, 58th Squadron,
 33rd Fighter Wing, glanced up out
 of his canopy in the direction indicated,
 and smiled to himself at the
 instinctive reaction. Nothing there
 but the familiar starry backdrop, the
 moon far down to the left. If the
 light wasn't right, a ship might be
 invisible at half a mile. He squeezed
 the throttle mike button. "Any IFF?"


 "No IFF."


 "O.K., let me know as soon as you
 have his course." Coulter squashed
 out his cigar and began his cockpit
 check, grinning without humor as he
 noticed that his breathing had deepened
 and his palms were moist on
 the controls. He looked down to
 make sure his radio was snug in its
 pocket on his leg; checked the thigh
 harness of his emergency rocket,
 wrapped in its thick belly pad; checked
 the paired tanks of oxygen behind
 him, hanging level from his shoulders
 into their niche in the "cradle."
 He flipped his helmet closed, locked
 it, and opened it again. He tossed
 a sardonic salute at the photograph
 of a young lady who graced the side
 of the cockpit. "Wish us luck, sugar."
 He pressed the mike button again.

THE GIRL IN HIS MIND
By ROBERT F. YOUNG


 [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from

 Worlds of Tomorrow April 1963

 Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that

 the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]
Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of
 love and lust

Question:
How much time has passed between Blake's night with Eldoria and his search for Sabrina York in his mind-world?

### REAL QUESTION — ANSWER THIS ONLY ###
Passage:
SLINGSHOT
BY

 IRVING W. LANDE
Illustrated by Emsh
The slingshot
 was, I believe, one of the few
 weapons of history that wasn't used in the last war.
 That doesn't mean it won't be used in the next!
"Got a bogey at three o'clock high.
 Range about six hundred miles."
 Johnson spoke casually, but his voice
 in the intercom was thin with tension.


 Captain Paul Coulter, commanding
 Space Fighter 308, 58th Squadron,
 33rd Fighter Wing, glanced up out
 of his canopy in the direction indicated,
 and smiled to himself at the
 instinctive reaction. Nothing there
 but the familiar starry backdrop, the
 moon far down to the left. If the
 light wasn't right, a ship might be
 invisible at half a mile. He squeezed
 the throttle mike button. "Any IFF?"


 "No IFF."


 "O.K., let me know as soon as you
 have his course." Coulter squashed
 out his cigar and began his cockpit
 check, grinning without humor as he
 noticed that his breathing had deepened
 and his palms were moist on
 the controls. He looked down to
 make sure his radio was snug in its
 pocket on his leg; checked the thigh
 harness of his emergency rocket,
 wrapped in its thick belly pad; checked
 the paired tanks of oxygen behind
 him, hanging level from his shoulders
 into their niche in the "cradle."
 He flipped his helmet closed, locked
 it, and opened it again. He tossed
 a sardonic salute at the photograph
 of a young lady who graced the side
 of the cockpit. "Wish us luck, sugar."
 He pressed the mike button again.

Passage:
THE GIRL IN HIS MIND
By ROBERT F. YOUNG


 [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from

 Worlds of Tomorrow April 1963

 Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that

 the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]
Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of
 love and lust

Question:
How much time has passed between Blake's night with Eldoria and his search for Sabrina York in his mind-world?

Options:
A: 7 years
B: 10 hours
C: 12 years

### REAL QUESTION — ANSWER THIS ONLY ###
Passage:
SLINGSHOT
BY

 IRVING W. LANDE
Illustrated by Emsh
The slingshot
 was, I believe, one of the few
 weapons of history that wasn't used in the last war.
 That doesn't mean it won't be used in the next!
"Got a bogey at three o'clock high.
 Range about six hundred miles."
 Johnson spoke casually, but his voice
 in the intercom was thin with tension.


 Captain Paul Coulter, commanding
 Space Fighter 308, 58th Squadron,
 33rd Fighter Wing, glanced up out
 of his canopy in the direction indicated,
 and smiled to himself at the
 instinctive reaction. Nothing there
 but the familiar starry backdrop, the
 moon far down to the left. If the
 light wasn't right, a ship might be
 invisible at half a mile. He squeezed
 the throttle mike button. "Any IFF?"


 "No IFF."


 "O.K., let me know as soon as you
 have his course." Coulter squashed
 out his cigar and began his cockpit
 check, grinning without humor as he
 noticed that his breathing had deepened
 and his palms were moist on
 the controls. He looked down to
 make sure his radio was snug in its
 pocket on his leg; checked the thigh
 harness of his emergency rocket,
 wrapped in its thick belly pad; checked
 the paired tanks of oxygen behind
 him, hanging level from his shoulders
 into their niche in the "cradle."
 He flipped his helmet closed, locked
 it, and opened it again. He tossed
 a sardonic salute at the photograph
 of a young lady who graced the side
 of the cockpit. "Wish us luck, sugar."
 He pressed the mike button again.

Passage:
THE GIRL IN HIS MIND
By ROBERT F. YOUNG


 [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from

 Worlds of Tomorrow April 1963

 Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that

 the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]
Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of
 love and lust

Question:
How much time has passed between Blake's night with Eldoria and his search for Sabrina York in his mind-world?

Options:
A: 7 years
B: 10 hours
C: 12 years
D: 1 hour

C: Because Blake is acting like he's her father, which is a sensitive topic for Deirdre because she lost her real parents.

### REAL QUESTION — ANSWER THIS ONLY ###
Passage:
SLINGSHOT
BY

 IRVING W. LANDE
Illustrated by Emsh
The slingshot
 was, I believe, one of the few
 weapons of history that wasn't used in the last war.
 That doesn't mean it won't be used in the next!
"Got a bogey at three o'clock high.
 Range about six hundred miles."
 Johnson spoke casually, but his voice
 in the intercom was thin with tension.


 Captain Paul Coulter, commanding
 Space Fighter 308, 58th Squadron,
 33rd Fighter Wing, glanced up out
 of his canopy in the direction indicated,
 and smiled to himself at the
 instinctive reaction. Nothing there
 but the familiar starry backdrop, the
 moon far down to the left. If the
 light wasn't right, a ship might be
 invisible at half a mile. He squeezed
 the throttle mike button. "Any IFF?"


 "No IFF."


 "O.K., let me know as soon as you
 have his course." Coulter squashed
 out his cigar and began his cockpit
 check, grinning without humor as he
 noticed that his breathing had deepened
 and his palms were moist on
 the controls. He looked down to
 make sure his radio was snug in its
 pocket on his leg; checked the thigh
 harness of his emergency rocket,
 wrapped in its thick belly pad; checked
 the paired tanks of oxygen behind
 him, hanging level from his shoulders
 into their niche in the "cradle."
 He flipped his helmet closed, locked
 it, and opened it again. He tossed
 a sardonic salute at the photograph
 of a young lady who graced the side
 of the cockpit. "Wish us luck, sugar."
 He pressed the mike button again.


 

Question:
What is unorthodox about Coulter and Garrities' navigation?

Options:
A: They used experimental ships with the cockpit on gimbals
B: They used the Solter coordinates
C: They spoke to one-another more than usual
D: They used a simple up/down and clock system

### REAL QUESTION — ANSWER THIS ONLY ###
Passage:
SLINGSHOT
BY

 IRVING W. LANDE
Illustrated by Emsh
The slingshot
 was, I believe, one of the few
 weapons of history that wasn't used in the last war.
 That doesn't mean it won't be used in the next!
"Got a bogey at three o'clock high.
 Range about six hundred miles."
 Johnson spoke casually, but his voice
 in the intercom was thin with tension.


 Captain Paul Coulter, commanding
 Space Fighter 308, 58th Squadron,
 33rd Fighter Wing, glanced up out
 of his canopy in the direction indicated,
 and smiled to himself at the
 instinctive reaction. Nothing there
 but the familiar starry backdrop, the
 moon far down to the left. If the
 light wasn't right, a ship might be
 invisible at half a mile. He squeezed
 the throttle mike button. "Any IFF?"


 "No IFF."


 "O.K., let me know as soon as you
 have his course." Coulter squashed
 out his cigar and began his cockpit
 check, grinning without humor as he
 noticed that his breathing had deepened
 and his palms were moist on
 the controls. He looked down to
 make sure his radio was snug in its
 pocket on his leg; checked the thigh
 harness of his emergency rocket,
 wrapped in its thick belly pad; checked
 the paired tanks of oxygen behind
 him, hanging level from his shoulders
 into their niche in the "cradle."
 He flipped his helmet closed, locked
 it, and opened it again. He tossed
 a sardonic salute at the photograph
 of a young lady who graced the side
 of the cockpit. "Wish us luck, sugar."
 He pressed the mike button again.


 

Question:
Why did Paul think that "these three minutes" were the worst?

Options:
A: The possibility of colliding with the enemy
B: The high amount of G-forces he experiences
C: The fact that he would run out of fuel after three minutes
D: The anticipation before firing on a target

 That doesn't mean it won't be used in the next!
"Got a bogey at three o'clock high.

 Johnson spoke casually, but his voice
 in the intercom was thin with tension.


 Captain Paul Coulter, commanding
 Space Fighter 308, 58th Squadron,
 33rd Fighter Wing, glanced up out
 of his canopy in the direction indicated,
 and smiled to himself at the
 instinctive reaction. Nothing there
 but the familiar starry backdrop, the
 moon far down to the left. If the
 light wasn't right, a ship might be
 invisible at half a mile. He squeezed
 the throttle mike button. "Any IFF?"


 "No IFF."


 "O.K., let me know as soon as you
 have his course." Coulter squashed
 out his cigar and began his cockpit
 check, grinning without humor as he
 noticed that his breathing had deepened
 and his palms were moist on
 the controls. He looked down to
 make sure his radio was snug in its
 pocket on his leg; checked the thigh
 harness of his emergency rocket,
 wrapped in its thick belly pad; checked
 the paired tanks of oxygen behind
 him, hanging level from his shoulders
 into their niche in the "cradle."
 He flipped his helmet closed, locked
 it, and opened it again. He tossed
 a sardonic salute at the photograph
 of a young lady who graced the side
 of the cockpit. "Wish us luck, sugar."
 He pressed the mike button again.


 

Question:
What was the ping sound that Coulter heard?

Options:
A: An enemy bullet hitting his ship
B: The enemy ship barely scraping his
C: A command from Johnson, the navigator
D: His bullet hitting the enemy

THE GIRL IN HIS MIND
By ROBERT F. YOUNG


 [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from

 Worlds of Tomorrow April 1963

 the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]
Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of
 love and lust

Question:
How much time has passed between Blake's night with Eldoria and his search for Sabrina York in his mind-world?

### REAL QUESTION — ANSWER THIS ONLY ###
Passage:
SLINGSHOT
BY

 IRVING W. LANDE
Illustrated by Emsh
The slingshot
 was, I believe, one of the few
 weapons of history that wasn't used in the last war.
 That doesn't mean it won't be used in the next!
"Got a bogey at three o'clock high.
 Range about six hundred miles."
 Johnson spoke casually, but his voice
 in the intercom was thin with tension.


 Captain Paul Coulter, commanding
 Space Fighter 308, 58th Squadron,
 33rd Fighter Wing, glanced up out
 of his canopy in the direction indicated,
 and smiled to himself at the
 instinctive reaction. Nothing there
 but the familiar starry backdrop, the
 moon far down to the left. If the
 light wasn't right, a ship might be
 invisible at half a mile. He squeezed
 the throttle mike button. "Any IFF?"


 "No IFF."


 "O.K., let me know as soon as you
 have his course." Coulter squashed
 out his cigar and began his cockpit
 check, grinning without humor as he
 noticed that his breathing had deepened
 and his palms were moist on
 the controls. He looked down to
 make sure his radio was snug in its
 pocket on his leg; checked the thigh
 harness of his emergency rocket,
 wrapped in its thick belly pad; checked
 the paired tanks of oxygen behind
 him, hanging level from his shoulders
 into their niche in the "cradle."
 He flipped his helmet closed, locked
 it, and opened it again. He tossed
 a sardonic salute at the photograph
 of a young lady who graced the side
 of the cockpit. "Wish us luck, sugar."
 He pressed the mike button again.


 

Question:
What was Paul's solution for not having to be in broadside battles anymore?

Options:
A: Using more of an element of surprise
B: Firing on enemy ships from the ground
C: Sending younger pilots instead of him
D: Using rockets instead of traditional machine guns

THE GIRL IN HIS MIND
By ROBERT F. YOUNG


 [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from

 Worlds of Tomorrow April 1963

 Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that

 the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]
Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of
 love and lust

Question:
How much time has passed between Blake's night with Eldoria and his search for Sabrina York in his mind-world?

A: 7 years
B: 10 hours

### REAL QUESTION — ANSWER THIS ONLY ###
Passage:
SLINGSHOT
BY

 IRVING W. LANDE
Illustrated by Emsh
The slingshot
 was, I believe, one of the few
 weapons of history that wasn't used in the last war.
 That doesn't mean it won't be used in the next!
"Got a bogey at three o'clock high.
 Range about six hundred miles."
 Johnson spoke casually, but his voice
 in the intercom was thin with tension.


 Captain Paul Coulter, commanding
 Space Fighter 308, 58th Squadron,
 33rd Fighter Wing, glanced up out
 of his canopy in the direction indicated,
 and smiled to himself at the
 instinctive reaction. Nothing there
 but the familiar starry backdrop, the
 moon far down to the left. If the
 light wasn't right, a ship might be
 invisible at half a mile. He squeezed
 the throttle mike button. "Any IFF?"


 "No IFF."


 "O.K., let me know as soon as you
 have his course." Coulter squashed
 out his cigar and began his cockpit
 check, grinning without humor as he
 noticed that his breathing had deepened
 and his palms were moist on
 the controls. He looked down to
 make sure his radio was snug in its
 pocket on his leg; checked the thigh
 harness of his emergency rocket,
 wrapped in its thick belly pad; checked
 the paired tanks of oxygen behind
 him, hanging level from his shoulders
 into their niche in the "cradle."
 He flipped his helmet closed, locked
 it, and opened it again. He tossed
 a sardonic salute at the photograph
 of a young lady who graced the side
 of the cockpit. "Wish us luck, sugar."
 He pressed the mike button again.


 

Question:

ILLUSTRATED BY VAN DONGEN

 mighty hunter and actor. But this time he was

 Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that

 the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]
Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of
 love and lust

Question:
How much time has passed between Blake's night with Eldoria and his search for Sabrina York in his mind-world?

A: 7 years
B: 10 hours

Passage:
THE HUNTERS
BY WILLIAM MORRISON
ILLUSTRATED BY VAN DONGEN
To all who didn't know him, Curt George was a
 mighty hunter and actor. But this time he was
 up against others who could really act, and
 whose business was the hunting of whole worlds.


 There were thirty or more of
 the little girls, their ages ranging
 apparently from nine to
 eleven, all of them chirping
 away like a flock of chicks as
 they followed the old mother hen
 past the line of cages. "Now,
 now, girls," called Miss Burton
 cheerily. "Don't scatter. I can't
 keep my eye on you if you get
 too far away from me. You,
 Hilda, give me that water pistol.
 No, don't fill it up first at that
 fountain. And Frances, stop
 bouncing your ball. You'll lose it
 through the bars, and a polar
 bear may get it and not want to
 give it back."


 Frances giggled. "Oh, Miss
 Burton, do you think the polar
 bear would want to play catch?"


 The two men who were looking
 on wore pleased smiles.
 "Charming," said Manto. "But
 somewhat unpredictable, despite
 all our experiences,
 muy amigo
 ."


 "No attempts at Spanish, Manto,
 not here. It calls attention to
 us. And you are not sure of the
 grammar anyway. You may find
 yourself saying things you do
 not intend."


 "Sorry, Palit. It wasn't an attempt
 to show my skill, I assure
 you. It's that by now I have a
 tendency to confuse one language
 with another."


 "I know. You were never a linguist.
 But about these interesting
 creatures—"


 "I suggest that they could

Question:
Where did the two extra girls in Miss Burton's group come from?

B: They were lost from another class

ILLUSTRATED BY VAN DONGEN
To all who didn't know him, Curt George was a
 mighty hunter and actor. But this time he was
 up against others who could really act, and
 whose business was the hunting of whole worlds.


 There were thirty or more of
 the little girls, their ages ranging
 apparently from nine to
 eleven, all of them chirping
 away like a flock of chicks as
 they followed the old mother hen
 past the line of cages. "Now,

 No, don't fill it up first at that
 fountain. And Frances, stop
 bouncing your ball. You'll lose it
 through the bars, and a polar
 bear may get it and not want to
 give it back."


 Frances giggled. "Oh, Miss

Passage:
THE HUNTERS
BY WILLIAM MORRISON
ILLUSTRATED BY VAN DONGEN
To all who didn't know him, Curt George was a
 mighty hunter and actor. But this time he was
 up against others who could really act, and
 whose business was the hunting of whole worlds.


 There were thirty or more of
 the little girls, their ages ranging
 apparently from nine to
 eleven, all of them chirping
 away like a flock of chicks as
 they followed the old mother hen
 past the line of cages. "Now,
 now, girls," called Miss Burton
 cheerily. "Don't scatter. I can't
 keep my eye on you if you get
 too far away from me. You,
 Hilda, give me that water pistol.
 No, don't fill it up first at that
 fountain. And Frances, stop
 bouncing your ball. You'll lose it
 through the bars, and a polar
 bear may get it and not want to
 give it back."


 Frances giggled. "Oh, Miss
 Burton, do you think the polar
 bear would want to play catch?"


 The two men who were looking
 on wore pleased smiles.
 "Charming," said Manto. "But
 somewhat unpredictable, despite
 all our experiences,
 muy amigo

 "No attempts at Spanish, Manto,
 not here. It calls attention to
 us. And you are not sure of the
 grammar anyway. You may find
 yourself saying things you do
 not intend."


 "Sorry, Palit. It wasn't an attempt
 to show my skill, I assure
 you. It's that by now I have a
 tendency to confuse one language
 with another."


 "I know. You were never a linguist.
 But about these interesting
 creatures—"

Passage:
THE HUNTERS
BY WILLIAM MORRISON
ILLUSTRATED BY VAN DONGEN
To all who didn't know him, Curt George was a
 mighty hunter and actor. But this time he was
 up against others who could really act, and
 whose business was the hunting of whole worlds.

 the little girls, their ages ranging
 apparently from nine to

 bouncing your ball. You'll lose it
 through the bars, and a polar
 bear may get it and not want to
 give it back."


 Frances giggled. "Oh, Miss
 Burton, do you think the polar
 bear would want to play catch?"

 yourself saying things you do
 not intend."

 to show my skill, I assure
 you. It's that by now I have a
 tendency to confuse one language
 with another."


 "I know. You were never a linguist.
 But about these interesting
 creatures—"


 "I suggest that they could

Passage:
THE HUNTERS
BY WILLIAM MORRISON
ILLUSTRATED BY VAN DONGEN
To all who didn't know him, Curt George was a
 mighty hunter and actor. But this time he was
 up against others who could really act, and
 whose business was the hunting of whole worlds.


 There were thirty or more of
 the little girls, their ages ranging
 apparently from nine to
 eleven, all of them chirping
 away like a flock of chicks as
 they followed the old mother hen
 past the line of cages. "Now,
 now, girls," called Miss Burton
 cheerily. "Don't scatter. I can't
 keep my eye on you if you get
 too far away from me. You,
 Hilda, give me that water pistol.
 No, don't fill it up first at that
 fountain. And Frances, stop
 bouncing your ball. You'll lose it
 through the bars, and a polar
 bear may get it and not want to
 give it back."


 Frances giggled. "Oh, Miss
 Burton, do you think the polar
 bear would want to play catch?"


 The two men who were looking
 on wore pleased smiles.
 "Charming," said Manto. "But
 somewhat unpredictable, despite
 all our experiences,

 ."


 "No attempts at Spanish, Manto,
 not here. It calls attention to
 us. And you are not sure of the
 grammar anyway. You may find
 yourself saying things you do
 not intend."


 "Sorry, Palit. It wasn't an attempt
 to show my skill, I assure
 you. It's that by now I have a
 tendency to confuse one language
 with another."


 "I know. You were never a linguist.
 But about these interesting
 creatures—"

Question:
What was likely Miss Burton's real motivation for "entertaining" Curt George?

Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of
 love and lust

Question:
How much time has passed between Blake's night with Eldoria and his search for Sabrina York in his mind-world?

Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of
 love and lust

Question:
Why does Deirdre get so upset when Blake Past suggests she go to prom with the young man?

Options:
A: Because Blake is trying to guilt Deirdre into going with the young man by telling her that it'll ease her conscience. 
B: Because Deirdre has fallen in love with Blake, despite his age, and wants him to take her to the prom.  
C: Because Blake is acting like he's her father, which is a sensitive topic for Deirdre because she lost her real parents. 
D: Because the young man gave up his right arm in order to afford tickets to the prom, and this disgusts Deirdre.

Passage:
THE HUNTERS
BY WILLIAM MORRISON
ILLUSTRATED BY VAN DONGEN
To all who didn't know him, Curt George was a
 mighty hunter and actor. But this time he was
 up against others who could really act, and
 whose business was the hunting of whole worlds.


 There were thirty or more of
 the little girls, their ages ranging
 apparently from nine to
 eleven, all of them chirping
 away like a flock of chicks as
 they followed the old mother hen
 past the line of cages. "Now,
 now, girls," called Miss Burton
 cheerily. "Don't scatter. I can't
 keep my eye on you if you get
 too far away from me. You,
 Hilda, give me that water pistol.
 No, don't fill it up first at that
 fountain. And Frances, stop
 bouncing your ball. You'll lose it
 through the bars, and a polar
 bear may get it and not want to
 give it back."


 Frances giggled. "Oh, Miss
 Burton, do you think the polar
 bear would want to play catch?"


 The two men who were looking
 on wore pleased smiles.
 "Charming," said Manto. "But
 somewhat unpredictable, despite
 all our experiences,
 muy amigo
 ."


 "No attempts at Spanish, Manto,
 not here. It calls attention to
 us. And you are not sure of the
 grammar anyway. You may find
 yourself saying things you do
 not intend."


 "Sorry, Palit. It wasn't an attempt
 to show my skill, I assure
 you. It's that by now I have a
 tendency to confuse one language
 with another."


 "I know. You were never a linguist.
 But about these interesting
 creatures—"

Passage:
THE HUNTERS
BY WILLIAM MORRISON
ILLUSTRATED BY VAN DONGEN
To all who didn't know him, Curt George was a
 mighty hunter and actor. But this time he was
 up against others who could really act, and
 whose business was the hunting of whole worlds.


 There were thirty or more of
 the little girls, their ages ranging
 apparently from nine to
 eleven, all of them chirping
 away like a flock of chicks as
 they followed the old mother hen
 past the line of cages. "Now,

 cheerily. "Don't scatter. I can't
 keep my eye on you if you get
 too far away from me. You,
 Hilda, give me that water pistol.

 fountain. And Frances, stop
 bouncing your ball. You'll lose it
 through the bars, and a polar
 bear may get it and not want to
 give it back."


 Frances giggled. "Oh, Miss
 Burton, do you think the polar
 bear would want to play catch?"


 The two men who were looking

 to show my skill, I assure
 you. It's that by now I have a
 tendency to confuse one language
 with another."


 "I know. You were never a linguist.
 But about these interesting
 creatures—"

The Staff of Life suddenly and

 disconcertingly sprouted wings

 —and mankind had to eat crow!
Illustrated by WOOD
AS a blisteringly hot but
 guaranteed weather-controlled
 future summer day
 dawned on the Mississippi Valley,
 the walking mills of Puffy Products
 ("Spike to Loaf in One
 Operation!") began to tread delicately
 on their centipede legs
 across the wheat fields of Kansas.


 The walking mills resembled fat
 metal serpents, rather larger than
 those Chinese paper dragons animated
 by files of men in procession.
 Sensory robot devices in
 their noses informed them that
 the waiting wheat had reached ripe
 perfection.


 As they advanced, their heads
 swung lazily from side to side, very
 much like snakes, gobbling the yellow
 grain. In their throats, it was
 threshed, the chaff bundled and
 burped aside for pickup by the
 crawl trucks of a chemical corporation,
 the kernels quick-dried
 and blown along into the mighty
 chests of the machines. There the
 tireless mills ground the kernels
 to flour, which was instantly sifted,
 the bran being packaged and
 dropped like the chaff for pickup.
 A cluster of tanks which gave
 the metal serpents a decidedly
 humpbacked appearance added
 water, shortening, salt and other

THE GIRL IN HIS MIND
By ROBERT F. YOUNG

 Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that

 the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]
Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of
 love and lust

Question:
How much time has passed between Blake's night with Eldoria and his search for Sabrina York in his mind-world?

B: 10 hours

Bread

By FRITZ LEIBER
The Staff of Life suddenly and

 disconcertingly sprouted wings

 —and mankind had to eat crow!
Illustrated by WOOD
AS a blisteringly hot but
 guaranteed weather-controlled
 future summer day
 dawned on the Mississippi Valley,
 the walking mills of Puffy Products
 ("Spike to Loaf in One
 Operation!") began to tread delicately
 on their centipede legs
 across the wheat fields of Kansas.


 The walking mills resembled fat
 metal serpents, rather larger than
 those Chinese paper dragons animated
 by files of men in procession.
 Sensory robot devices in
 their noses informed them that
 the waiting wheat had reached ripe
 perfection.


 As they advanced, their heads
 swung lazily from side to side, very
 much like snakes, gobbling the yellow
 grain. In their throats, it was
 threshed, the chaff bundled and
 burped aside for pickup by the
 crawl trucks of a chemical corporation,
 the kernels quick-dried
 and blown along into the mighty
 chests of the machines. There the
 tireless mills ground the kernels
 to flour, which was instantly sifted,
 the bran being packaged and
 dropped like the chaff for pickup.
 A cluster of tanks which gave
 the metal serpents a decidedly
 humpbacked appearance added
 water, shortening, salt and other

 conspicuously labeled "Carbon

Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of
 love and lust

Question:
Why does shame flame in Blake's cheeks when Deirdre goes to prepare Eldoria's dias?

Options:
A: He is embarrassed at the thought that Deirdre might enter the room while he is sleeping with Eldoria. 
B: He feels that prostitution is morally reprehensible. 
C: He feels guilty about sleeping with Eldoria when there's a child in the hut, Deirdre, who knows exactly what's going on. 
D: He feels guilty about wishing Deirdre was older so he could sleep with her instead. 

Correct Answer: C

Bread

 Overhead

The Staff of Life suddenly and

 disconcertingly sprouted wings

 —and mankind had to eat crow!

AS a blisteringly hot but
 guaranteed weather-controlled
 future summer day
 dawned on the Mississippi Valley,
 the walking mills of Puffy Products
 ("Spike to Loaf in One
 Operation!") began to tread delicately
 on their centipede legs
 across the wheat fields of Kansas.


 The walking mills resembled fat
 metal serpents, rather larger than
 those Chinese paper dragons animated
 by files of men in procession.
 Sensory robot devices in
 their noses informed them that
 the waiting wheat had reached ripe
 perfection.


 As they advanced, their heads
 swung lazily from side to side, very
 much like snakes, gobbling the yellow
 grain. In their throats, it was
 threshed, the chaff bundled and
 burped aside for pickup by the
 crawl trucks of a chemical corporation,
 the kernels quick-dried
 and blown along into the mighty
 chests of the machines. There the
 tireless mills ground the kernels
 to flour, which was instantly sifted,
 the bran being packaged and
 dropped like the chaff for pickup.
 A cluster of tanks which gave
 the metal serpents a decidedly
 humpbacked appearance added
 water, shortening, salt and other
 ingredients, some named and some
 not. The dough was at the same
 time infused with gas from a tank
 conspicuously labeled "Carbon
 Dioxide" ("No Yeast Creatures
 in Your Bread!").


 Thus instantly risen, the dough

A: Lighter and paler
B: Stronger and harder
C: Heavier and darker
