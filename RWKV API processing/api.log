Every man's mind is a universe with countless

The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the

Illustrated by WOOD
AS a blisteringly hot but
 guaranteed weather-controlled
 future summer day
 dawned on the Mississippi Valley,
 the walking mills of Puffy Products
 ("Spike to Loaf in One
 Operation!") began to tread delicately
 on their centipede legs
 across the wheat fields of Kansas.


 The walking mills resembled fat
 metal serpents, rather larger than
 those Chinese paper dragons animated
 by files of men in procession.
 Sensory robot devices in
 their noses informed them that
 the waiting wheat had reached ripe
 perfection.


 As they advanced, their heads
 swung lazily from side to side, very
 much like snakes, gobbling the yellow
 grain. In their throats, it was
 threshed, the chaff bundled and
 burped aside for pickup by the
 crawl trucks of a chemical corporation,
 the kernels quick-dried
 and blown along into the mighty

 dropped like the chaff for pickup.
 A cluster of tanks which gave
 the metal serpents a decidedly
 humpbacked appearance added
 water, shortening, salt and other
 ingredients, some named and some

 conspicuously labeled "Carbon

Passage:
THE GIRL IN HIS MIND
By ROBERT F. YOUNG


 [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from

 Worlds of Tomorrow April 1963

 Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that

 the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]
Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of
 love and lust

Question:
Why does shame flame in Blake's cheeks when Deirdre goes to prepare Eldoria's dias?

Options:
A: He is embarrassed at the thought that Deirdre might enter the room while he is sleeping with Eldoria. 
B: He feels that prostitution is morally reprehensible. 
C: He feels guilty about sleeping with Eldoria when there's a child in the hut, Deirdre, who knows exactly what's going on. 
D: He feels guilty about wishing Deirdre was older so he could sleep with her instead. 

Correct Answer: C

The Staff of Life suddenly and

 dawned on the Mississippi Valley,
 the walking mills of Puffy Products

 on their centipede legs
 across the wheat fields of Kansas.


 The walking mills resembled fat
 metal serpents, rather larger than
 those Chinese paper dragons animated
 by files of men in procession.
 Sensory robot devices in
 their noses informed them that
 the waiting wheat had reached ripe
 perfection.


 As they advanced, their heads
 swung lazily from side to side, very
 much like snakes, gobbling the yellow

 threshed, the chaff bundled and
 burped aside for pickup by the
 crawl trucks of a chemical corporation,
 the kernels quick-dried
 and blown along into the mighty
 chests of the machines. There the
 tireless mills ground the kernels
 to flour, which was instantly sifted,
 the bran being packaged and
 dropped like the chaff for pickup.
 A cluster of tanks which gave
 the metal serpents a decidedly
 humpbacked appearance added

Question:
Why were the Puffyloaves flaming when hit with incendiary rounds?

AS a blisteringly hot but
 guaranteed weather-controlled
 future summer day
 dawned on the Mississippi Valley,
 the walking mills of Puffy Products

THE GIRL IN HIS MIND
By ROBERT F. YOUNG


 [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from

 Worlds of Tomorrow April 1963

 Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that

 the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]
Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of
 love and lust

Question:
How much time has passed between Blake's night with Eldoria and his search for Sabrina York in his mind-world?

A: 7 years
B: 10 hours

Question:
Why does Deirdre get so upset when Blake Past suggests she go to prom with the young man?

Options:
A: Because Blake is trying to guilt Deirdre into going with the young man by telling her that it'll ease her conscience. 
B: Because Deirdre has fallen in love with Blake, despite his age, and wants him to take her to the prom.  
C: Because Blake is acting like he's her father, which is a sensitive topic for Deirdre because she lost her real parents. 
D: Because the young man gave up his right arm in order to afford tickets to the prom, and this disgusts Deirdre.

### REAL QUESTION — ANSWER THIS ONLY ###
Passage:
WIND
By CHARLES L. FONTENAY
When you have an engine with no fuel, and fuel
 
without an engine, and a life-and-death deadline
 
to meet, you have a problem indeed. Unless you are
 
a stubborn Dutchman—and Jan Van Artevelde was
 
the stubbornest Dutchman on Venus.
JAN WILLEM van Artevelde
 claimed descent from William
 of Orange. He had no genealogy
 to prove it, but on Venus there
 was no one who could disprove it,
 either.


 Jan Willem van Artevelde
 smoked a clay pipe, which only a
 Dutchman can do properly, because
 the clay bit grates on less
 stubborn teeth.


 Jan needed all his Dutch stubbornness,
 and a good deal of pure
 physical strength besides, to maneuver
 the roach-flat groundcar
 across the tumbled terrain of
 Den Hoorn into the teeth of the
 howling gale that swept from the
 west. The huge wheels twisted
 and jolted against the rocks outside,
 and Jan bounced against his
 seat belt, wrestled the steering
 wheel and puffed at his
pijp
. The
 mild aroma of Heerenbaai-Tabak
 filled the airtight groundcar.


 There came a new swaying
 that was not the roughness of
 the terrain. Through the thick
 windshield Jan saw all the
 ground about him buckle and
 heave for a second or two before
 it settled to rugged quiescence
 again. This time he was really
 heaved about.


 Jan mentioned this to the
 groundcar radio.


 "That's the third time in half
 an hour," he commented. "The
 place tosses like the IJsselmeer
 on a rough day."


 "You just don't forget it
isn't
the Z

Question:
Why was Jan in the groundcar diving across Den Hoorn?

Options:
A: To retrieve a medical patient
B: To flee the storm that was hitting the main station
C: To refill his fuel
D: To bring supplies to the settlement of Rathole

Every man's mind is a universe with countless

The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated

The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted

 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."

 love and lust

Question:
Why does Deirdre get so upset when Blake Past suggests she go to prom with the young man?

Options:
A: Because Blake is trying to guilt Deirdre into going with the young man by telling her that it'll ease her conscience. 
B: Because Deirdre has fallen in love with Blake, despite his age, and wants him to take her to the prom.  
C: Because Blake is acting like he's her father, which is a sensitive topic for Deirdre because she lost her real parents. 
D: Because the young man gave up his right arm in order to afford tickets to the prom, and this disgusts Deirdre.

### REAL QUESTION — ANSWER THIS ONLY ###
Passage:
WIND
By CHARLES L. FONTENAY
When you have an engine with no fuel, and fuel
 
without an engine, and a life-and-death deadline
 
to meet, you have a problem indeed. Unless you are
 
a stubborn Dutchman—and Jan Van Artevelde was
 
the stubbornest Dutchman on Venus.
JAN WILLEM van Artevelde
 claimed descent from William
 of Orange. He had no genealogy
 to prove it, but on Venus there
 was no one who could disprove it,
 either.


 Jan Willem van Artevelde
 smoked a clay pipe, which only a
 Dutchman can do properly, because
 the clay bit grates on less
 stubborn teeth.


 Jan needed all his Dutch stubbornness,
 and a good deal of pure
 physical strength besides, to maneuver
 the roach-flat groundcar
 across the tumbled terrain of
 Den Hoorn into the teeth of the
 howling gale that swept from the
 west. The huge wheels twisted
 and jolted against the rocks outside,
 and Jan bounced against his
 seat belt, wrestled the steering
 wheel and puffed at his
pijp
. The
 mild aroma of Heerenbaai-Tabak
 filled the airtight groundcar.


 There came a new swaying
 that was not the roughness of
 the terrain. Through the thick
 windshield Jan saw all the
 ground about him buckle and
 heave for a second or two before
 it settled to rugged quiescence
 again. This time he was really
 heaved about.


 Jan mentioned this to the
 groundcar radio.


 "That's the third time in half
 an hour," he commented. "The
 place tosses like the IJsselmeer
 on a rough day."


 "You just don't forget it
isn't
the Z

Question:
Why was Jan unable to return to Oosport in the same way that he left?

Options:
A: The storms became too intense
B: He forgot the route that he took
C: His ground car ran out of fuel
D: An earthquake altered the terrain

WIND
By CHARLES L. FONTENAY
When you have an engine with no fuel, and fuel
 
without an engine, and a life-and-death deadline
 
to meet, you have a problem indeed. Unless you are
 
a stubborn Dutchman—and Jan Van Artevelde was
 
the stubbornest Dutchman on Venus.
JAN WILLEM van Artevelde
 claimed descent from William
 of Orange. He had no genealogy
 to prove it, but on Venus there
 was no one who could disprove it,
 either.


 Jan Willem van Artevelde
 smoked a clay pipe, which only a
 Dutchman can do properly, because
 the clay bit grates on less
 stubborn teeth.


 Jan needed all his Dutch stubbornness,
 and a good deal of pure
 physical strength besides, to maneuver
 the roach-flat groundcar
 across the tumbled terrain of
 Den Hoorn into the teeth of the
 howling gale that swept from the
 west. The huge wheels twisted
 and jolted against the rocks outside,
 and Jan bounced against his
 seat belt, wrestled the steering
 wheel and puffed at his
pijp
. The
 mild aroma of Heerenbaai-Tabak
 filled the airtight groundcar.


 There came a new swaying
 that was not the roughness of
 the terrain. Through the thick
 windshield Jan saw all the
 ground about him buckle and
 heave for a second or two before
 it settled to rugged quiescence
 again. This time he was really
 heaved about.


 Jan mentioned this to the

### REAL QUESTION — ANSWER THIS ONLY ###
Passage:
WIND
By CHARLES L. FONTENAY
When you have an engine with no fuel, and fuel
 
without an engine, and a life-and-death deadline
 
to meet, you have a problem indeed. Unless you are
 
a stubborn Dutchman—and Jan Van Artevelde was
 
the stubbornest Dutchman on Venus.
JAN WILLEM van Artevelde
 claimed descent from William
 of Orange. He had no genealogy
 to prove it, but on Venus there
 was no one who could disprove it,
 either.


 Jan Willem van Artevelde
 smoked a clay pipe, which only a
 Dutchman can do properly, because
 the clay bit grates on less
 stubborn teeth.


 Jan needed all his Dutch stubbornness,
 and a good deal of pure
 physical strength besides, to maneuver
 the roach-flat groundcar
 across the tumbled terrain of
 Den Hoorn into the teeth of the
 howling gale that swept from the
 west. The huge wheels twisted
 and jolted against the rocks outside,
 and Jan bounced against his
 seat belt, wrestled the steering
 wheel and puffed at his
pijp
. The
 mild aroma of Heerenbaai-Tabak
 filled the airtight groundcar.


 There came a new swaying
 that was not the roughness of
 the terrain. Through the thick
 windshield Jan saw all the
 ground about him buckle and
 heave for a second or two before
 it settled to rugged quiescence
 again. This time he was really
 heaved about.


 Jan mentioned this to the
 groundcar radio.


 "That's the third time in half
 an hour," he commented. "The
 place tosses like the IJsselmeer
 on a rough day."


 "You just don't forget it
isn't
the Z

Question:
What was Jan referring to when he thanked Sanchez for the good luck wishes?

Options:
A: Dealing with the symptoms of Venus Shadow
B: Helping the sick child
C: The difficulty of the first crossing
D: Returning to Earth

Passage:
WIND
By CHARLES L. FONTENAY
When you have an engine with no fuel, and fuel
 
without an engine, and a life-and-death deadline
 
to meet, you have a problem indeed. Unless you are
 
a stubborn Dutchman—and Jan Van Artevelde was
 
the stubbornest Dutchman on Venus.
JAN WILLEM van Artevelde
 claimed descent from William
 of Orange. He had no genealogy
 to prove it, but on Venus there
 was no one who could disprove it,
 either.


 Jan Willem van Artevelde
 smoked a clay pipe, which only a
 Dutchman can do properly, because
 the clay bit grates on less
 stubborn teeth.


 Jan needed all his Dutch stubbornness,
 and a good deal of pure
 physical strength besides, to maneuver
 the roach-flat groundcar
 across the tumbled terrain of
 Den Hoorn into the teeth of the
 howling gale that swept from the
 west. The huge wheels twisted
 and jolted against the rocks outside,
 and Jan bounced against his
 seat belt, wrestled the steering
 wheel and puffed at his
pijp
. The
 mild aroma of Heerenbaai-Tabak
 filled the airtight groundcar.


 There came a new swaying
 that was not the roughness of
 the terrain. Through the thick
 windshield Jan saw all the
 ground about him buckle and
 heave for a second or two before
 it settled to rugged quiescence
 again. This time he was really
 heaved about.


 Jan mentioned this to the
 groundcar radio.


 "That's the third time in half
 an hour," he commented. "The
 place tosses like the IJsselmeer
 on a rough day."

Question:

THE GIRL IN HIS MIND
By ROBERT F. YOUNG

 Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that

 the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]
Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of
 love and lust

### REAL QUESTION — ANSWER THIS ONLY ###
Passage:
WIND
By CHARLES L. FONTENAY
When you have an engine with no fuel, and fuel
 
without an engine, and a life-and-death deadline
 
to meet, you have a problem indeed. Unless you are
 
a stubborn Dutchman—and Jan Van Artevelde was
 
the stubbornest Dutchman on Venus.
JAN WILLEM van Artevelde
 claimed descent from William
 of Orange. He had no genealogy
 to prove it, but on Venus there
 was no one who could disprove it,
 either.


 Jan Willem van Artevelde
 smoked a clay pipe, which only a
 Dutchman can do properly, because
 the clay bit grates on less
 stubborn teeth.


 Jan needed all his Dutch stubbornness,
 and a good deal of pure
 physical strength besides, to maneuver
 the roach-flat groundcar
 across the tumbled terrain of
 Den Hoorn into the teeth of the
 howling gale that swept from the
 west. The huge wheels twisted
 and jolted against the rocks outside,
 and Jan bounced against his
 seat belt, wrestled the steering
 wheel and puffed at his
pijp
. The
 mild aroma of Heerenbaai-Tabak
 filled the airtight groundcar.


 There came a new swaying
 that was not the roughness of
 the terrain. Through the thick
 windshield Jan saw all the
 ground about him buckle and
 heave for a second or two before
 it settled to rugged quiescence
 again. This time he was really
 heaved about.


 Jan mentioned this to the
 groundcar radio.


 "That's the third time in half
 an hour," he commented. "The
 place tosses like the IJsselmeer
 on a rough day."


 "You just don't forget it
isn't
the Z

Question:
Why could the helicopters from the main settlement pick up Jan and Diego?

Options:
A: They were out of fuel
B: The wind was too severe
C: They had been moved north with the naval base
D: The distance was too far

Passage:
THE GIRL IN HIS MIND
By ROBERT F. YOUNG


 [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from

 Worlds of Tomorrow April 1963

 Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that

 the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]
Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of
 love and lust

Question:
How much time has passed between Blake's night with Eldoria and his search for Sabrina York in his mind-world?

Options:
A: 7 years
B: 10 hours
C: 12 years
D: 1 hour

### REAL QUESTION — ANSWER THIS ONLY ###
Passage:
WIND
By CHARLES L. FONTENAY
When you have an engine with no fuel, and fuel
 
without an engine, and a life-and-death deadline
 
to meet, you have a problem indeed. Unless you are
 
a stubborn Dutchman—and Jan Van Artevelde was
 
the stubbornest Dutchman on Venus.
JAN WILLEM van Artevelde
 claimed descent from William
 of Orange. He had no genealogy
 to prove it, but on Venus there
 was no one who could disprove it,
 either.


 Jan Willem van Artevelde
 smoked a clay pipe, which only a
 Dutchman can do properly, because
 the clay bit grates on less
 stubborn teeth.


 Jan needed all his Dutch stubbornness,
 and a good deal of pure
 physical strength besides, to maneuver
 the roach-flat groundcar
 across the tumbled terrain of
 Den Hoorn into the teeth of the
 howling gale that swept from the
 west. The huge wheels twisted
 and jolted against the rocks outside,
 and Jan bounced against his
 seat belt, wrestled the steering
 wheel and puffed at his
pijp
. The
 mild aroma of Heerenbaai-Tabak
 filled the airtight groundcar.


 There came a new swaying
 that was not the roughness of
 the terrain. Through the thick
 windshield Jan saw all the
 ground about him buckle and
 heave for a second or two before
 it settled to rugged quiescence
 again. This time he was really
 heaved about.


 Jan mentioned this to the
 groundcar radio.


 "That's the third time in half
 an hour," he commented. "The
 place tosses like the IJsselmeer
 on a rough day."


 "You just don't forget it
isn't
the Z

Question:
What was Jan's reason for wanting to return to Rathole after the rescue mission?

Options:
A: To rescue more sick settlers
B: To visit Mrs. Murillo
C: To bring fuel and supplies
D: To return the platform

### REAL QUESTION — ANSWER THIS ONLY ###
Passage:
WIND
By CHARLES L. FONTENAY
When you have an engine with no fuel, and fuel
 
without an engine, and a life-and-death deadline
 
to meet, you have a problem indeed. Unless you are
 
a stubborn Dutchman—and Jan Van Artevelde was
 
the stubbornest Dutchman on Venus.
JAN WILLEM van Artevelde
 claimed descent from William
 of Orange. He had no genealogy
 to prove it, but on Venus there
 was no one who could disprove it,
 either.


 Jan Willem van Artevelde
 smoked a clay pipe, which only a
 Dutchman can do properly, because
 the clay bit grates on less
 stubborn teeth.


 Jan needed all his Dutch stubbornness,
 and a good deal of pure
 physical strength besides, to maneuver
 the roach-flat groundcar
 across the tumbled terrain of
 Den Hoorn into the teeth of the
 howling gale that swept from the
 west. The huge wheels twisted
 and jolted against the rocks outside,
 and Jan bounced against his
 seat belt, wrestled the steering
 wheel and puffed at his
pijp
. The
 mild aroma of Heerenbaai-Tabak
 filled the airtight groundcar.


 There came a new swaying
 that was not the roughness of
 the terrain. Through the thick
 windshield Jan saw all the
 ground about him buckle and
 heave for a second or two before
 it settled to rugged quiescence
 again. This time he was really
 heaved about.


 Jan mentioned this to the
 groundcar radio.


 "That's the third time in half
 an hour," he commented. "The
 place tosses like the IJsselmeer
 on a rough day."


 "You just don't forget it
isn't
the Z

Question:
Why did the fuel from the groundcar not work in the flying platform?

Options:
A: The fuel was too cold to be combusted
B: The fuel was old and no longer good
C: It was the wrong type of fuel
D: The engines in the flying platform had gone bad

FONTENAY\nWhen you have an engine with no fuel, and fuel\n \nwithout an engine, and a life-and-death deadline\n \nto meet, you have a problem indeed. Unless you are\n \na stubborn Dutchman—and Jan Van Artevelde was\n \nthe stubbornest Dutchman on Venus.\nJAN WILLEM van Artevelde\n claimed descent from William\n of Orange. He had no genealogy\n to prove it, but on Venus there\n was no one who could disprove it,\n either.\n\n\n Jan Willem van Artevelde\n smoked a clay pipe, which only a\n Dutchman can do properly, because\n the clay bit grates on less\n stubborn teeth.\n\n\n Jan needed all his Dutch stubbornness,\n and a good deal of pure\n physical strength besides, to maneuver\n the roach-flat groundcar\n across the tumbled terrain of\n Den Hoorn into the teeth of the\n howling gale that swept from the\n west. The huge wheels twisted\n and jolted against the rocks outside,\n and Jan bounced against his\n seat belt, wrestled the steering\n wheel and puffed at his\npijp\n. The\n mild aroma of Heerenbaai-Tabak\n filled the airtight groundcar.\n\n\n There came a new swaying\n that was not the roughness of\n the terrain. Through the thick\n windshield Jan saw all the\n ground about him buckle and\n heave for a second or two before\n it settled to rugged quiescence\n again. This time he was really\n heaved about.\n\n\n Jan mentioned this to the\n groundcar radio.\n\n\n \"That's the third time in half\n an hour,\" he commented. \"The\n place tosses like the IJsselmeer\n on a rough day.\"\n\n\n \"You just don't forget it\nisn't\nthe Z\n\nQuestion:\nWhat did Jan end up using to power the flying platform?\n\nOptions:\nA: A sail\nB: A broom\nC: A windmill\nD: Fuel from the ground car\n\n\nYour Answer:", "role": "user", "name": null, "raw": false}], "model": "rwkv", "stream": false, "stop": ["\n\nUser", "\n\nQuestion", "\n\nQ", "\n\nHuman", "\n\nBob", "\n\nAssistant", "\n\nAnswer", "\n\nA", "\n\nBot", "\n\nAlice", "\n\nObservation", "\n\nUser", "\n\nAss"], "tools": null, "tool_choice": "auto", "user_name": null, "assistant_name": null, "system_name": null, "presystem": false}

By ROBERT F. YOUNG

Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of
 love and lust

B: 10 hours

And in\\n space-type translation ... the effect may be the same!\\nIllustrated by Schoenherr\\nThe cell had been put together more efficiently than any Korvin had\\n ever been in. But that was only natural, he told himself sadly; the\\n Tr\'en were an efficient people. All the preliminary reports had agreed\\n on that; their efficiency, as a matter of fact, was what had made\\n Korvin\'s arrival a necessity. They were well into the atomic era, and\\n were on the verge of developing space travel. Before long they\'d be\\n settling the other planets of their system, and then the nearer stars.\\n Faster-than-light travel couldn\'t be far away, for the magnificently\\n efficient physical scientists of the Tr\'en\\u2014and that would mean, in\\n the ordinary course of events, an invitation to join the Comity of\\n Planets.\\n\\n\\n An invitation, the Comity was sure, which the Tr\'en would not accept.\\n\\n\\n Korvin stretched out on the cell\'s single bunk, a rigid affair which\\n was hardly meant for comfort, and sighed. He\'d had three days of\\n isolation, with nothing to do but explore the resources of his own\\n mind. He\'d tried some of the ancient Rhine experiments, but that was\\n no good; he still didn\'t show any particular psi talents. He couldn\'t\\n unlock the cell door with his unaided mind; he couldn\'t even alter the\\n probability of a single dust-mote\'s Brownian path through the somewhat\\n smelly air. Nor could he disappear from his cell and appear, as if by\\n magic, several miles away near the slightly-damaged hulk of his ship,\\n to the wonder and amazement of his Tr\'en captors.\\n\\n\\n He could do, as a matter of fact, precisely nothing. He wished quietly\\n that the Tr\'en had seen fit to give him a pack of cards, or a book, or\\n even a folder of tourist pictures. The Wonders of Tr\'en, according to\\n all the advance reports, were likely to be pretty boring, but they\'d\\n have been better than nothing.\\n\\n\\n In any decently-run jail, he told himself with indignation, there\\n would at least have been other prisoners to talk to. But on Tr\'en\\n Korvin was all alone.\\n\\n\\n True, every night the guards came in and gave him a concentrated\\n lesson in the local language, but Korvin failed to get much pleasure\\n out of that, being unconscious at the time. But now he was equipped to\\n discuss almost anything from philosophy to plumbing, but there was\\n nobody to discuss it with. He changed position on the bunk and stared\\n at the walls. The Tr\'en were efficient; there weren\'t even any\\n imperfections in the smooth surface to distract him.\\n\\n\\n He wasn\'t tired and he wasn\'t hungry; his captors had left him with a\\n full stock of food concentrates.\\n\\n\\n But he was almightily bored, and about ready to tell anything to\\n anyone, just for the chance at a little conversation.\\n\\n\\n As he reached this dismal conclusion, the cell door opened. Korvin got\\n up off the bunk in a hurry and spun around to face his visitor.\\n\\n\\n The Tr\'en was tall, and slightly green.\\n\\n\\n He looked, as all the Tr\'en did, vaguely humanoid\\u2014that is, if you\\n don\'t bother to examine him closely. Life in the universe appeared to\\n be rigidly limited to humanoid types on oxygen planets; Korvin didn\'t\\n know why, and neither did anybody else. There were a lot of theories,\\n but none that accounted for all the facts satisfactorily. Korvin\\n really didn\'t care about it; it was none of his business.\\n\\n\\n The Tr\'en regarded him narrowly through catlike pupils. \\"You are\\n Korvin,\\" he said.\\n\\n\\n It was a ritual, Korvin had learned. \\"You are of the Tr\'en,\\" he\\n replied. The green being nodded.\\n\\n\\n \\"I am Didyak of the Tr\'en,\\" he said. Amenities over with, he relaxed\\n slightly\\u2014but no more than slightly\\u2014and came into the cell, closing\\n the door behind him. Korvin thought of jumping the Tr\'en, but decided\\n quickly against it. He was a captive, and it was unwise to assume that\\n his captors had no more resources than the ones he saw: a small\\n translucent pistollike affair in a holster at the Tr\'en\'s side, and a\\n small knife in a sheath at the belt. Those Korvin could deal with; but\\n there might be almost anything else hidden and ready to fire on him.\\n\\n\\n \\"What do you want with me?\\" Korvin said. The Tr\'en speech\\u2014apparently\\n there was only one language on the planet\\u2014was stiff and slightly\\n awkward, but easily enough learned under drug hypnosis; it was the\\n most rigorously logical construction of its kind Korvin had ever come\\n across. It reminded him of some of the mathematical metalanguages he\'d\\n dealt with back on Earth, in training; but it was more closely and\\n carefully constructed than even those marvels.\\n\\n\\n \\"I want nothing with you,\\" Didyak said, leaning against the\\n door-frame. \\"You have other questions?\\"\\n\\n\\n Korvin sighed. \\"What are you doing here, then?\\" he asked. As\\n conversation, it wasn\'t very choice; but it was, he admitted, better\\n than solitude.\\n\\n\\n \\"I am leaning against the door,\\" Didyak said. The Tr\'en literalist\\n approach to the smallest problems of everyday living was a little hard\\n to get the hang of, Korvin told himself bitterly. He thought for a\\n second.\\n\\n\\n \\"Why did you come to me?\\" he said at last.\\n\\n\\n Didyak beamed at him. The sight was remarkably unpleasant, involving\\n as it did the disclosure of the Tr\'en fifty-eight teeth, mostly\\n pointed. Korvin stared back impassively. \\"I have been ordered to come\\n to you,\\" Didyak said, \\"by the Ruler. The Ruler wishes to talk with\\n you.\\"\\n\\n\\n It wasn\'t quite \\"talk\\"; that was a general word in the Tr\'en language,\\n and Didyak had used a specific meaning, roughly: \\"gain information\\n from, by peaceful and vocal means.\\" Korvin filed it away for future\\n reference. \\"Why did the Ruler not come to me?\\" Korvin asked.\\n\\n\\n \\"The Ruler is the Ruler,\\" Didyak said, slightly discomfited. \\"You are\\n to go to him. Such is his command.\\"\\n\\n\\n Korvin shrugged, sighed and smoothed back his hair. \\"I obey the\\n command of the Ruler,\\" he said\\u2014another ritual. Everybody obeyed the\\n command of the Ruler. If you didn\'t, you never had a second chance to\\n try.\\n\\n\\n But Korvin meant exactly what he\'d said. He was going to obey the\\n commands of the Ruler of the Tr\'en\\u2014and remove the Tr\'en threat from\\n the rest of the galaxy forever.\\n\\n\\n That, after all, was his job.\\nThe Room of the Ruler was large, square and excessively brown. The\\n walls were dark-brown, the furnishings\\u2014a single great chair, several\\n kneeling-benches and a small table near the chair\\u2014were light-brown,\\n of some metallic substance, and even the drapes were tan. It was,\\n Korvin decided, much too much of a bad idea, even when the color\\n contrast of the Tr\'en themselves were figured in.\\n\\n\\n The Ruler himself, a Tr\'en over seven feet tall and correspondingly\\n broad, sat in the great chair, his four fingers tapping gently on the\\n table near him, staring at Korvin and his guards. The guards stood on\\n either side of their captive, looking as impassive as jade statues,\\n six and a half feet high.\\n\\n\\n Korvin wasn\'t attempting to escape. He wasn\'t pleading with the Ruler.\\n He wasn\'t defying the Ruler, either. He was just answering questions.\\n\\n\\n The Tr\'en liked to have everything clear. They were a logical race.\\n The Ruler had started with Korvin\'s race, his name, his sex\\u2014if\\n any\\u2014and whether or not his appearance were normal for humanity.\\n\\n\\n Korvin was answering the last question. \\"Some men are larger than I\\n am,\\" he said, \\"and some are smaller.\\"\\n\\n\\n \\"Within what limits?\\"\\n\\n\\n Korvin shrugged. \\"Some are over eight feet tall,\\" he said, \\"and others\\n under four feet.\\" He used the Tr\'en measurement scale, of course; it\\n didn\'t seem necessary, though, to mention that both extremes of height\\n were at the circus-freak level. \\"Then there is a group of humans,\\" he\\n went on, \\"who are never more than a foot and a half in height, and\\n usually less than that\\u2014approximately nine or ten inches. We call\\n these\\nchildren\\n,\\" he volunteered helpfully.\\n\\n\\n \\"Approximately?\\" the Ruler growled. \\"We ask for precision here,\\" he\\n said. \\"We are scientific men. We are exact.\\"\\n\\n\\n Korvin nodded hurriedly. \\"Our race is more ... more approximate,\\" he\\n said apologetically.\\n\\n\\n \\"Slipshod,\\" the Ruler muttered.\\n\\n\\n \\"Undoubtedly,\\" Korvin agreed politely. \\"I\'ll try to do the best I can\\n for you.\\"\\n\\n\\n \\"You will answer my questions,\\" the Ruler said, \\"with exactitude.\\" He\\n paused, frowning slightly. \\"You landed your ship on this planet,\\" he\\n went on. \\"Why?\\"\\n\\n\\n \\"My job required it,\\" Korvin said.\\n\\n\\n \\"A clumsy lie,\\" the Ruler said. \\"The ship crashed; our examinations\\n prove that beyond any doubt.\\"\\n\\n\\n \\"True,\\" Korvin said.\\n\\n\\n \\"And it is your job to crash your ship?\\" the Ruler said. \\"Wasteful.\\"\\n\\n\\n Korvin shrugged again. \\"What I say is true,\\" he announced. \\"Do you\\n have tests for such matters?\\"\\n\\n\\n \\"We do,\\" the Ruler told him. \\"We are an exact and a scientific race. A\\n machine for the testing of truth has been adjusted to your physiology.\\n It will be attached to you.\\"\\n\\n\\n Korvin looked around and saw it coming through the door, pushed by two\\n technicians. It was large and squat and metallic, and it had wheels,\\n dials, blinking lights, tubes and wires, and a seat with armrests and\\n straps. It was obviously a form of lie-detector\\u2014and Korvin felt\\n himself marveling again at this race. Earth science had nothing to\\n match their enormous command of the physical universe; adapting a\\n hypnop\\u00e6dic language-course to an alien being so quickly had been\\n wonder enough, but adapting the perilously delicate mechanisms that\\n necessarily made up any lie-detector machinery was almost a miracle.\\n The Tr\'en, under other circumstances, would have been a valuable\\n addition to the Comity of Nations.\\n\\n\\n Being what they were, though, they could only be a menace. And\\n Korvin\'s appreciation of the size of that menace was growing hourly.\\n\\n\\n He hoped the lie-detector had been adjusted correctly. If it showed\\n him telling an untruth, he wasn\'t likely to live long, and his\\n job\\u2014not to mention the strongest personal inclinations\\u2014demanded most\\n strongly that he stay alive.\\n\\n\\n He swallowed hard. But when the technicians forced him down into the\\n seat, buckled straps around him, attached wires and electrodes and\\n elastic bands to him at appropriate places and tightened some final\\n screws, he made no resistance.\\n\\n\\n \\"We shall test the machine,\\" the Ruler said. \\"In what room are you?\\"\\n\\n\\n \\"In the Room of the Ruler,\\" Korvin said equably.\\n\\n\\n \\"Are you standing or sitting?\\"\\n\\n\\n \\"I am sitting,\\" Korvin said.\\n\\n\\n \\"Are you a\\nchulad\\n?\\" the Ruler asked. A\\nchulad\\nwas a small native\\n pet, Korvin knew, something like a greatly magnified deathwatch\\n beetle.\\n\\n\\n \\"I am not,\\" he said.\\nThe Ruler looked to his technicians for a signal, and nodded on\\n receiving it. \\"You will tell an untruth now,\\" he said. \\"Are you\\n standing or sitting?\\"\\n\\n\\n \\"I am standing,\\" Korvin said.\\n\\n\\n The technicians gave another signal. The Ruler looked, in his frowning\\n manner, reasonably satisfied. \\"The machine,\\" he announced, \\"has been\\n adjusted satisfactorily to your physiology. The questioning will now\\n continue.\\"\\n\\n\\n Korvin swallowed again. The test hadn\'t really seemed extensive enough\\n to him. But, after all, the Tr\'en knew their business, better than\\n anyone else could know it. They had the technique and the logic and\\n the training.\\n\\n\\n He hoped they were right.\\n\\n\\n The Ruler was frowning at him. Korvin did his best to look receptive.\\n \\"Why did you land your ship on this planet?\\" the Ruler said.\\n\\n\\n \\"My job required it,\\" Korvin said.\\n\\n\\n The Ruler nodded. \\"Your job is to crash your ship,\\" he said. \\"It is\\n wasteful but the machines tell me it is true. Very well, then; we\\n shall find out more about your job. Was the crash intentional?\\"\\n\\n\\n Korvin looked sober. \\"Yes,\\" he said.\\n\\n\\n The Ruler blinked. \\"Very well,\\" he said. \\"Was your job ended when the\\n ship crashed?\\" The Tr\'en word, of course, wasn\'t\\nended\\n, nor did it\\n mean exactly that. As nearly as Korvin could make out, it meant\\n \\"disposed of for all time.\\"\\n\\n\\n \\"No,\\" he said.\\n\\n\\n \\"What else does your job entail?\\" the Ruler said.\\n\\n\\n Korvin decided to throw his first spoke into the wheel. \\"Staying\\n alive.\\"\\n\\n\\n The Ruler roared. \\"Do not waste time with the obvious!\\" he shouted.\\n \\"Do not try to trick us; we are a logical and scientific race! Answer\\n correctly.\\"\\n\\n\\n \\"I have told the truth,\\" Korvin said.\\n\\n\\n \\"But it is not\\u2014not the truth we want,\\" the Ruler said.\\n\\n\\n Korvin shrugged. \\"I replied to your question,\\" he said. \\"I did not\\n know that there was more than one kind of truth. Surely the truth is\\n the truth, just as the Ruler is the Ruler?\\"\\n\\n\\n \\"I\\u2014\\" The Ruler stopped himself in mid-roar. \\"You try to confuse the\\n Ruler,\\" he said at last, in an approximation of his usual one. \\"But\\n the Ruler will not be confused. We have experts in matters of\\n logic\\"\\u2014the Tr\'en word seemed to mean\\nright-saying\\n\\u2014\\"who will advise\\n the Ruler. They will be called.\\"\\n\\n\\n Korvin\'s guards were standing around doing nothing of importance now\\n that their captor was strapped down in the lie-detector. The Ruler\\n gestured and they went out the door in a hurry.\\n\\n\\n The Ruler looked down at Korvin. \\"You will find that you cannot trick\\n us,\\" he said. \\"You will find that such fiddling\\"\\u2014\\nchulad-like\\nKorvin\\n translated\\u2014\\"attempts will get you nowhere.\\"\\n\\n\\n Korvin devoutly hoped so.\\nThe experts in logic arrived shortly, and in no uncertain terms Korvin\\n was given to understand that logical paradox was not going to confuse\\n anybody on the planet. The barber who did, or didn\'t, shave himself,\\n the secretary of the club whose members were secretaries, Achilles and\\n the tortoise, and all the other lovely paradox-models scattered around\\n were so much primer material for the Tr\'en. \\"They can be treated\\n mathematically,\\" one of the experts, a small emerald-green being, told\\n Korvin thinly. \\"Of course, you would not understand the mathematics.\\n But that is not important. You need only understand that we cannot be\\n confused by such means.\\"\\n\\n\\n \\"Good,\\" Korvin said.\\n\\n\\n The experts blinked. \\"Good?\\" he said.\\n\\n\\n \\"Naturally,\\" Korvin said in a friendly tone.\\n\\n\\n The expert frowned horribly, showing all of his teeth. Korvin did his\\n best not to react. \\"Your plan is a failure,\\" the expert said, \\"and you\\n call this a good thing. You can mean only that your plan is different\\n from the one we are occupied with.\\"\\n\\n\\n \\"True,\\" Korvin said.\\n\\n\\n There was a short silence. The expert beamed. He examined the\\n indicators of the lie-detector with great care. \\"What is your plan?\\"\\n he said at last, in a conspiratorial whisper.\\n\\n\\n \\"To answer your questions, truthfully and logically,\\" Korvin said.\\n\\n\\n The silence this time was even longer.\\n\\n\\n \\"The machine says that you tell the truth,\\" the experts said at last,\\n in a awed tone. \\"Thus, you must be a traitor to your native planet.\\n You must want us to conquer your planet, and have come here secretly\\n to aid us.\\"\\n\\n\\n Korvin was very glad that wasn\'t a question. It was, after all, the\\n only logical deduction.\\n\\n\\n But it happened to be wrong.\\n\\"The name of your planet is Earth?\\" the Ruler asked. A few minutes had\\n passed; the experts were clustered around the single chair. Korvin was\\n still strapped to the machine; a logical race makes use of a traitor,\\n but a logical race does not trust him.\\n\\n\\n \\"Sometimes,\\" Korvin said.\\n\\n\\n \\"It has other names?\\" the Ruler said.\\n\\n\\n \\"It has no name,\\" Korvin said truthfully. The Tr\'en idiom was like the\\n Earthly one; and certainly a planet had no name. People attached names\\n to it, that was all. It had none of its own.\\n\\n\\n \\"Yet you call it Earth?\\" the Ruler said.\\n\\n\\n \\"I do,\\" Korvin said, \\"for convenience.\\"\\n\\n\\n \\"Do you know its location?\\" the Ruler said.\\n\\n\\n \\"Not with exactitude,\\" Korvin said.\\n\\n\\n There was a stir. \\"But you can find it again,\\" the Ruler said.\\n\\n\\n \\"I can,\\" Korvin said.\\n\\n\\n \\"And you will tell us about it?\\" the Ruler went on.\\n\\n\\n \\"I will,\\" Korvin said, \\"so far as I am able.\\"\\n\\n\\n \\"We will wish to know about weapons,\\" the Ruler said, \\"and about plans\\n and fortifications. But we must first know of the manner of decision\\n on this planet. Is your planet joined with others in a government or\\n does it exist alone?\\"\\n\\n\\n Korvin nearly smiled. \\"Both,\\" he said.\\n\\n\\n A short silence was broken by one of the attendant experts. \\"We have\\n theorized that an underling may be permitted to make some of his own\\n decisions, leaving only the more extensive ones for the master. This\\n seems to us inefficient and liable to error, yet it is a possible\\n system. Is it the system you mean?\\"\\n\\n\\n Very sharp, Korvin told himself grimly. \\"It is,\\" he said.\\n\\n\\n \\"Then the government which reigns over several planets is supreme,\\"\\n the Ruler said.\\n\\n\\n \\"It is,\\" Korvin said.\\n\\n\\n \\"Who is it that governs?\\" the Ruler said.\\n\\n\\n The key question had, at last, been asked. Korvin felt grateful that\\n the logical Tr\'en had determined to begin from the beginning, instead\\n of going off after details of armament first; it saved a lot of time.\\n\\n\\n \\"The answer to that question,\\" Korvin said, \\"cannot be given to you.\\"\\n\\n\\n \\"Any question of fact has an answer,\\" the Ruler snapped. \\"A paradox is\\n not involved here; a government exists, and some being is the\\n governor. Perhaps several beings share this task; perhaps machines do\\n the work. But where there is a government, there is a governor. Is\\n this agreed?\\"\\n\\n\\n \\"Certainly,\\" Korvin said. \\"It is completely obvious and true.\\"\\n\\n\\n \\"The planet from which you come is part of a system of planets which\\n are governed, you have said,\\" the Ruler went on.\\n\\n\\n \\"True,\\" Korvin said.\\n\\n\\n \\"Then there is a governor for this system,\\" the Ruler said.\\n\\n\\n \\"True,\\" Korvin said again.\\n\\n\\n The ruler sighed gently. \\"Explain this governor to us,\\" he said.\\n\\n\\n Korvin shrugged. \\"The explanation cannot be given to you.\\"\\n\\n\\n The Ruler turned to a group of his experts and a short muttered\\n conversation took place. At its end the Ruler turned his gaze back to\\n Korvin. \\"Is the deficiency in you?\\" he said. \\"Are you in some way\\n unable to describe this government?\\"\\n\\n\\n \\"It can be described,\\" Korvin said.\\n\\n\\n \\"Then you will suffer unpleasant consequences if you describe it to\\n us?\\" the Ruler went on.\\n\\n\\n \\"I will not,\\" Korvin said.\\n\\n\\n It was the signal for another conference. With some satisfaction,\\n Korvin noticed that the Tr\'en were becoming slightly puzzled; they\\n were no longer moving and speaking with calm assurance.\\n\\n\\n The plan was taking hold.\\n\\n\\n The Ruler had finished his conference. \\"You are attempting again to\\n confuse us,\\" he said.\\n\\n\\n Korvin shook his head earnestly. \\"I am attempting,\\" he said, \\"not to\\n confuse you.\\"\\n\\n\\n \\"Then I ask for an answer,\\" the Ruler said.\\n\\n\\n \\"I request that I be allowed to ask a question,\\" Korvin said.\\n\\n\\n The Ruler hesitated, then nodded. \\"Ask it,\\" he said. \\"We shall answer\\n it if we see fit to do so.\\"\\n\\n\\n Korvin tried to look grateful. \\"Well, then,\\" he said, \\"what is your\\n government?\\"\\n\\n\\n The Ruler beckoned to a heavy-set green being, who stepped forward\\n from a knot of Tr\'en, inclined his head in Korvin\'s direction, and\\n began. \\"Our government is the only logical form of government,\\" he\\n said in a high, sweet tenor. \\"The Ruler orders all, and his subjects\\n obey. In this way uniformity is gained, and this uniformity aids in\\n the speed of possible action and in the weight of action. All Tr\'en\\n act instantly in the same manner. The Ruler is adopted by the previous\\n Ruler; in this way we are assured of a common wisdom and a steady\\n judgment.\\"\\n\\n\\n \\"You have heard our government defined,\\" the Ruler said. \\"Now, you\\n will define yours for us.\\"\\n\\n\\n Korvin shook his head. \\"If you insist,\\" he said, \\"I\'ll try it. But you\\n won\'t understand it.\\"\\n\\n\\n The Ruler frowned. \\"We shall understand,\\" he said. \\"Begin. Who governs\\n you?\\"\\n\\n\\n \\"None,\\" Korvin said.\\n\\n\\n \\"But you are governed?\\"\\n\\n\\n Korvin nodded. \\"Yes.\\"\\n\\n\\n \\"Then there is a governor,\\" the Ruler insisted.\\n\\n\\n \\"True,\\" Korvin said. \\"But everyone is the governor.\\"\\n\\n\\n \\"Then there is no government,\\" the Ruler said. \\"There is no single\\n decision.\\"\\n\\n\\n \\"No,\\" Korvin said equably, \\"there are many decisions binding on all.\\"\\n\\n\\n \\"Who makes them binding?\\" the Ruler asked. \\"Who forces you to accept\\n these decisions? Some of them must be unfavorable to some beings?\\"\\n\\n\\n \\"Many of them are unfavorable,\\" Korvin said. \\"But we are not forced to\\n accept them.\\"\\n\\n\\n \\"Do you act against your own interests?\\"\\n\\n\\n Korvin shrugged. \\"Not knowingly,\\" he said. The Ruler flashed a look at\\n the technicians handling the lie-detector. Korvin turned to see their\\n expression. They needed no words; the lie-detector was telling them,\\n perfectly obviously, that he was speaking the truth. But the truth\\n wasn\'t making any sense. \\"I told you you wouldn\'t understand it,\\" he\\n said.\\n\\n\\n \\"It is a defect in your explanation,\\" the Ruler almost snarled.\\n\\n\\n \\"My explanation is as exact as it can be,\\" he said.\\n\\n\\n The Ruler breathed gustily. \\"Let us try something else,\\" he said.\\n \\"Everyone is the governor. Do you share a single mind? A racial mind\\n has been theorized, though we have met with no examples\\u2014\\"\\n\\n\\n \\"Neither have we,\\" Korvin said. \\"We are all individuals, like\\n yourselves.\\"\\n\\n\\n \\"But with no single ruler to form policy, to make decisions\\u2014\\"\\n\\n\\n \\"We have no need of one,\\" Korvin said calmly.\\n\\n\\n \\"Ah,\\" the Ruler said suddenly, as if he saw daylight ahead. \\"And why\\n not?\\"\\n\\n\\n \\"We call our form of government\\ndemocracy\\n,\\" Korvin said. \\"It means\\n the rule of the people. There is no need for another ruler.\\"\\n\\n\\n One of the experts piped up suddenly. \\"The beings themselves rule each\\n other?\\" he said. \\"This is clearly impossible; for, no one being can\\n have the force to compel acceptance of his commands. Without his\\n force, there can be no effective rule.\\"\\n\\n\\n \\"That is our form of government,\\" Korvin said.\\n\\n\\n \\"You are lying,\\" the expert said.\\n\\n\\n One of the technicians chimed in: \\"The machine tells us\\u2014\\"\\n\\n\\n \\"Then the machine is faulty,\\" the expert said. \\"It will be corrected.\\"\\n\\n\\n Korvin wondered, as the technicians argued, how long they\'d take\\n studying the machine, before they realized it didn\'t have any defects\\n to correct. He hoped it wasn\'t going to be too long; he could foresee\\n another stretch of boredom coming. And, besides, he was getting\\n homesick.\\n\\n\\n It took three days\\u2014but boredom never really had a chance to set in.\\n Korvin found himself the object of more attention than he had hoped\\n for; one by one, the experts came to his cell, each with a different\\n method of resolving the obvious contradictions in his statements.\\n\\n\\n Some of them went away fuming. Others simply went away, puzzled.\\n\\n\\n On the third day Korvin escaped.\\n\\n\\n It wasn\'t very difficult; he hadn\'t thought it would be. Even the most\\n logical of thinking beings has a subconscious as well as a conscious\\n mind, and one of the ways of dealing with an insoluble problem is to\\n make the problem disappear. There were only two ways of doing that,\\n and killing the problem\'s main focus was a little more complicated.\\n That couldn\'t be done by the subconscious mind; the conscious had to\\n intervene somewhere. And it couldn\'t.\\n\\n\\n Because that would mean recognizing, fully and consciously, that the\\n problem\\nwas\\ninsoluble. And the Tr\'en weren\'t capable of that sort of\\n thinking.\\n\\n\\n Korvin thanked his lucky stars that their genius had been restricted\\n to the physical and mathematical. Any insight at all into the mental\\n sciences would have given them the key to his existence, and his\\n entire plan, within seconds.\\n\\n\\n But, then, it was lack of that insight that had called for this\\n particular plan. That, and the political structure of the Tr\'en.\\n\\n\\n The same lack of insight let the Tr\'en subconscious work on his\\n escape without any annoying distractions in the way of deep\\n reflection. Someone left a door unlocked and a weapon nearby\\u2014all\\n quite intent, Korvin was sure. Getting to the ship was a little more\\n complicated, but presented no new problems; he was airborne, and then\\n space-borne, inside of a few hours after leaving the cell.\\n\\n\\n He set his course, relaxed, and cleared his mind. He had no psionic\\n talents, but the men at Earth Central did; he couldn\'t receive\\n messages, but he could send them. He sent one now.\\nMission accomplished; the Tr\'en aren\'t about to come\\n marauding out into space too soon. They\'ve been given food\\n for thought\\u2014nice indigestible food that\'s going to stick in\\n their craws until they finally manage to digest it. But they\\n can\'t digest it and stay what they are; you\'ve got to be\\n democratic, to some extent, to understand the idea. What\\n keeps us obeying laws we ourselves make? What keeps us\\n obeying laws that make things inconvenient for us? Sheer\\n self-interest, of course\\u2014but try to make a Tr\'en see it!\\nWith one government and one language, they just weren\'t\\n equipped for translation. They were too efficient physically\\n to try for the mental sciences at all. No mental sciences,\\n no insight into my mind or their own\\u2014and that means no\\n translation.\\nBut\\u2014damn it\\u2014I wish I were home already.\\nI\'m bored absolutely stiff!\\nTHE END\\n\\nQuestion:\\nWhy did the Tr\'en leave Korvin\'s door unlocked and a weapon nearby?\\nOptions:\\nA: They were so caught up trying to figure out  Korvin\'s answers that they became somewhat careless in guarding him. \\nB: Their subconscious knew that Korvin was an insoluble problem. This same subconscious led them to provide resources for his escape so they wouldn\'t have to deal with him anymore. \\nC: They were tired of the Ruler\'s dictatorship and intentionally provided resources for Korvin\'s escape in hopes that he would help them overthrow the Ruler.  \\nD: After their interview with Korvin, they determined he was wasteful and confusing, but not a threat. In order to avoid another confusing interaction with him, they simply provided resources for his escape. \\nAnswer:", "raw": false}], "stream": false, "max_tokens": 2, "temperature": 0.0}'

Passage:
 THE GIRL IN HIS MIND
By ROBERT F. YOUNG


 [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from

 Worlds of Tomorrow April 1963

Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of
 love and lust
Question:
How much time has passed between Blake's night with Eldoria and his search for Sabrina York in his mind-world?
Options:
A: 7 years
B: 10 hours
C: 12 years
D: 1 hour

 IN

 TRANSLATION
By
LARRY M.

 HARRIS
In language translation, you may get a literally accurate
 word-for-word translation ... but miss the meaning entirely. And in
 space-type translation ... the effect may be the same!
Illustrated by Schoenherr
The cell had been put together more efficiently than any Korvin had
 ever been in. But that was only natural, he told himself sadly; the
 Tr'en were an efficient people. All the preliminary reports had agreed
 on that; their efficiency, as a matter of fact, was what had made
 Korvin's arrival a necessity. They were well into the atomic era, and
 were on the verge of developing space travel. Before long they'd be
 settling the other planets of their system, and then the nearer stars.
 Faster-than-light travel couldn't be far away, for the magnificently
 efficient physical scientists of the Tr'en—and that would mean, in
 the ordinary course of events, an invitation to join the Comity of
 Planets.


 An invitation, the Comity was sure, which the Tr'en would not accept.


 Korvin stretched out on the cell's single bunk, a rigid affair which
 was hardly meant for comfort, and sighed. He'd had three days of
 isolation, with nothing to do but explore the resources of his own
 mind. He'd tried some of the ancient Rhine experiments, but that was
 no good; he still didn't show any particular psi talents. He couldn't
 unlock the cell door with his unaided mind; he couldn't even alter the
 probability of a single dust-mote's Brownian path through the somewhat
 smelly air. Nor could he disappear from his cell and appear, as if by
 magic, several miles away near the slightly-damaged hulk of his ship,
 to the wonder and amazement of his Tr'en captors.


 He could do, as a matter of fact, precisely nothing. He wished quietly
 that the Tr'en had seen fit to give him a pack of cards, or a book, or
 even a folder of tourist pictures. The Wonders of Tr'en, according to
 all the advance reports, were likely to be pretty boring, but they'd
 have been better than nothing.


 In any decently-run jail, he told himself with indignation, there
 would at least have been other prisoners to talk to. But on Tr'en
 Korvin was all alone.


 True, every night the guards came in and gave him a concentrated
 lesson in the local language, but Korvin failed to get much pleasure
 out of that, being unconscious at the time. But now he was equipped to
 discuss almost anything from philosophy to plumbing, but there was
 nobody to discuss it with. He changed position on the bunk and stared
 at the walls. The Tr'en were efficient; there weren't even any
 imperfections in the smooth surface to distract him.


 He wasn't tired and he wasn't hungry; his captors had left him with a
 full stock of food concentrates.


 But he was almightily bored, and about ready to tell anything to
 anyone, just for the chance at a little conversation.


 As he reached this dismal conclusion, the cell door opened. Korvin got
 up off the bunk in a hurry and spun around to face his visitor.


 The Tr'en was tall, and slightly green.


 He looked, as all the Tr'en did, vaguely humanoid—that is, if you
 don't bother to examine him closely. Life in the universe appeared to
 be rigidly limited to humanoid types on oxygen planets; Korvin didn't
 know why, and neither did anybody else. There were a lot of theories,
 but none that accounted for all the facts satisfactorily. Korvin
 really didn't care about it; it was none of his business.


 The Tr'en regarded him narrowly through catlike pupils. "You are
 Korvin," he said.


 It was a ritual, Korvin had learned. "You are of the Tr'en," he
 replied. The green being nodded.


 "I am Didyak of the Tr'en," he said. Amenities over with, he relaxed
 slightly—but no more than slightly—and came into the cell, closing
 the door behind him. Korvin thought of jumping the Tr'en, but decided
 quickly against it. He was a captive, and it was unwise to assume that
 his captors had no more resources than the ones he saw: a small
 translucent pistollike affair in a holster at the Tr'en's side, and a
 small knife in a sheath at the belt. Those Korvin could deal with; but
 there might be almost anything else hidden and ready to fire on him.


 "What do you want with me?" Korvin said. The Tr'en speech—apparently
 there was only one language on the planet—was stiff and slightly
 awkward, but easily enough learned under drug hypnosis; it was the
 most rigorously logical construction of its kind Korvin had ever come
 across. It reminded him of some of the mathematical metalanguages he'd
 dealt with back on Earth, in training; but it was more closely and
 carefully constructed than even those marvels.


 "I want nothing with you," Didyak said, leaning against the
 door-frame. "You have other questions?"


 Korvin sighed. "What are you doing here, then?" he asked. As
 conversation, it wasn't very choice; but it was, he admitted, better
 than solitude.


 "I am leaning against the door," Didyak said. The Tr'en literalist
 approach to the smallest problems of everyday living was a little hard
 to get the hang of, Korvin told himself bitterly. He thought for a
 second.


 "Why did you come to me?" he said at last.


 Didyak beamed at him. The sight was remarkably unpleasant, involving
 as it did the disclosure of the Tr'en fifty-eight teeth, mostly
 pointed. Korvin stared back impassively. "I have been ordered to come
 to you," Didyak said, "by the Ruler. The Ruler wishes to talk with
 you."


 It wasn't quite "talk"; that was a general word in the Tr'en language,
 and Didyak had used a specific meaning, roughly: "gain information
 from, by peaceful and vocal means." Korvin filed it away for future
 reference. "Why did the Ruler not come to me?" Korvin asked.


 "The Ruler is the Ruler," Didyak said, slightly discomfited. "You are
 to go to him. Such is his command."


 Korvin shrugged, sighed and smoothed back his hair. "I obey the
 command of the Ruler," he said—another ritual. Everybody obeyed the
 command of the Ruler. If you didn't, you never had a second chance to
 try.


 But Korvin meant exactly what he'd said. He was going to obey the
 commands of the Ruler of the Tr'en—and remove the Tr'en threat from
 the rest of the galaxy forever.


 That, after all, was his job.
The Room of the Ruler was large, square and excessively brown. The
 walls were dark-brown, the furnishings—a single great chair, several
 kneeling-benches and a small table near the chair—were light-brown,
 of some metallic substance, and even the drapes were tan. It was,
 Korvin decided, much too much of a bad idea, even when the color
 contrast of the Tr'en themselves were figured in.


 The Ruler himself, a Tr'en over seven feet tall and correspondingly
 broad, sat in the great chair, his four fingers tapping gently on the
 table near him, staring at Korvin and his guards. The guards stood on
 either side of their captive, looking as impassive as jade statues,
 six and a half feet high.


 Korvin wasn't attempting to escape. He wasn't pleading with the Ruler.
 He wasn't defying the Ruler, either. He was just answering questions.


 The Tr'en liked to have everything clear. They were a logical race.
 The Ruler had started with Korvin's race, his name, his sex—if
 any—and whether or not his appearance were normal for humanity.


 Korvin was answering the last question. "Some men are larger than I
 am," he said, "and some are smaller."


 "Within what limits?"


 Korvin shrugged. "Some are over eight feet tall," he said, "and others
 under four feet." He used the Tr'en measurement scale, of course; it
 didn't seem necessary, though, to mention that both extremes of height
 were at the circus-freak level. "Then there is a group of humans," he
 went on, "who are never more than a foot and a half in height, and
 usually less than that—approximately nine or ten inches. We call
 these
children
," he volunteered helpfully.


 "Approximately?" the Ruler growled. "We ask for precision here," he
 said. "We are scientific men. We are exact."


 Korvin nodded hurriedly. "Our race is more ... more approximate," he
 said apologetically.


 "Slipshod," the Ruler muttered.


 "Undoubtedly," Korvin agreed politely. "I'll try to do the best I can
 for you."


 "You will answer my questions," the Ruler said, "with exactitude." He
 paused, frowning slightly. "You landed your ship on this planet," he
 went on. "Why?"


 "My job required it," Korvin said.


 "A clumsy lie," the Ruler said. "The ship crashed; our examinations
 prove that beyond any doubt."


 "True," Korvin said.


 "And it is your job to crash your ship?" the Ruler said. "Wasteful."


 Korvin shrugged again. "What I say is true," he announced. "Do you
 have tests for such matters?"


 "We do," the Ruler told him. "We are an exact and a scientific race. A
 machine for the testing of truth has been adjusted to your physiology.
 It will be attached to you."


 Korvin looked around and saw it coming through the door, pushed by two
 technicians. It was large and squat and metallic, and it had wheels,
 dials, blinking lights, tubes and wires, and a seat with armrests and
 straps. It was obviously a form of lie-detector—and Korvin felt
 himself marveling again at this race. Earth science had nothing to
 match their enormous command of the physical universe; adapting a
 hypnopædic language-course to an alien being so quickly had been
 wonder enough, but adapting the perilously delicate mechanisms that
 necessarily made up any lie-detector machinery was almost a miracle.
 The Tr'en, under other circumstances, would have been a valuable
 addition to the Comity of Nations.


 Being what they were, though, they could only be a menace. And
 Korvin's appreciation of the size of that menace was growing hourly.


 He hoped the lie-detector had been adjusted correctly. If it showed
 him telling an untruth, he wasn't likely to live long, and his
 job—not to mention the strongest personal inclinations—demanded most
 strongly that he stay alive.


 He swallowed hard. But when the technicians forced him down into the
 seat, buckled straps around him, attached wires and electrodes and
 elastic bands to him at appropriate places and tightened some final
 screws, he made no resistance.


 "We shall test the machine," the Ruler said. "In what room are you?"


 "In the Room of the Ruler," Korvin said equably.


 "Are you standing or sitting?"


 "I am sitting," Korvin said.


 "Are you a
chulad
?" the Ruler asked. A
chulad
was a small native
 pet, Korvin knew, something like a greatly magnified deathwatch
 beetle.


 "I am not," he said.
The Ruler looked to his technicians for a signal, and nodded on
 receiving it. "You will tell an untruth now," he said. "Are you
 standing or sitting?"


 "I am standing," Korvin said.


 The technicians gave another signal. The Ruler looked, in his frowning
 manner, reasonably satisfied. "The machine," he announced, "has been
 adjusted satisfactorily to your physiology. The questioning will now
 continue."


 Korvin swallowed again. The test hadn't really seemed extensive enough
 to him. But, after all, the Tr'en knew their business, better than
 anyone else could know it. They had the technique and the logic and
 the training.


 He hoped they were right.


 The Ruler was frowning at him. Korvin did his best to look receptive.
 "Why did you land your ship on this planet?" the Ruler said.


 "My job required it," Korvin said.


 The Ruler nodded. "Your job is to crash your ship," he said. "It is
 wasteful but the machines tell me it is true. Very well, then; we
 shall find out more about your job. Was the crash intentional?"


 Korvin looked sober. "Yes," he said.


 The Ruler blinked. "Very well," he said. "Was your job ended when the
 ship crashed?" The Tr'en word, of course, wasn't
ended
, nor did it
 mean exactly that. As nearly as Korvin could make out, it meant
 "disposed of for all time."


 "No," he said.


 "What else does your job entail?" the Ruler said.


 Korvin decided to throw his first spoke into the wheel. "Staying
 alive."


 The Ruler roared. "Do not waste time with the obvious!" he shouted.
 "Do not try to trick us; we are a logical and scientific race! Answer
 correctly."


 "I have told the truth," Korvin said.


 "But it is not—not the truth we want," the Ruler said.


 Korvin shrugged. "I replied to your question," he said. "I did not
 know that there was more than one kind of truth. Surely the truth is
 the truth, just as the Ruler is the Ruler?"


 "I—" The Ruler stopped himself in mid-roar. "You try to confuse the
 Ruler," he said at last, in an approximation of his usual one. "But
 the Ruler will not be confused. We have experts in matters of
 logic"—the Tr'en word seemed to mean
right-saying
—"who will advise
 the Ruler. They will be called."


 Korvin's guards were standing around doing nothing of importance now
 that their captor was strapped down in the lie-detector. The Ruler
 gestured and they went out the door in a hurry.


 The Ruler looked down at Korvin. "You will find that you cannot trick
 us," he said. "You will find that such fiddling"—
chulad-like
Korvin
 translated—"attempts will get you nowhere."


 Korvin devoutly hoped so.
The experts in logic arrived shortly, and in no uncertain terms Korvin
 was given to understand that logical paradox was not going to confuse
 anybody on the planet. The barber who did, or didn't, shave himself,
 the secretary of the club whose members were secretaries, Achilles and
 the tortoise, and all the other lovely paradox-models scattered around
 were so much primer material for the Tr'en. "They can be treated
 mathematically," one of the experts, a small emerald-green being, told
 Korvin thinly. "Of course, you would not understand the mathematics.
 But that is not important. You need only understand that we cannot be
 confused by such means."


 "Good," Korvin said.


 The experts blinked. "Good?" he said.


 "Naturally," Korvin said in a friendly tone.


 The expert frowned horribly, showing all of his teeth. Korvin did his
 best not to react. "Your plan is a failure," the expert said, "and you
 call this a good thing. You can mean only that your plan is different
 from the one we are occupied with."


 "True," Korvin said.


 There was a short silence. The expert beamed. He examined the
 indicators of the lie-detector with great care. "What is your plan?"
 he said at last, in a conspiratorial whisper.


 "To answer your questions, truthfully and logically," Korvin said.


 The silence this time was even longer.


 "The machine says that you tell the truth," the experts said at last,
 in a awed tone. "Thus, you must be a traitor to your native planet.
 You must want us to conquer your planet, and have come here secretly
 to aid us."


 Korvin was very glad that wasn't a question. It was, after all, the
 only logical deduction.


 But it happened to be wrong.
"The name of your planet is Earth?" the Ruler asked. A few minutes had
 passed; the experts were clustered around the single chair. Korvin was
 still strapped to the machine; a logical race makes use of a traitor,
 but a logical race does not trust him.


 "Sometimes," Korvin said.


 "It has other names?" the Ruler said.


 "It has no name," Korvin said truthfully. The Tr'en idiom was like the
 Earthly one; and certainly a planet had no name. People attached names
 to it, that was all. It had none of its own.


 "Yet you call it Earth?" the Ruler said.


 "I do," Korvin said, "for convenience."


 "Do you know its location?" the Ruler said.


 "Not with exactitude," Korvin said.


 There was a stir. "But you can find it again," the Ruler said.


 "I can," Korvin said.


 "And you will tell us about it?" the Ruler went on.


 "I will," Korvin said, "so far as I am able."


 "We will wish to know about weapons," the Ruler said, "and about plans
 and fortifications. But we must first know of the manner of decision
 on this planet. Is your planet joined with others in a government or
 does it exist alone?"


 Korvin nearly smiled. "Both," he said.


 A short silence was broken by one of the attendant experts. "We have
 theorized that an underling may be permitted to make some of his own
 decisions, leaving only the more extensive ones for the master. This
 seems to us inefficient and liable to error, yet it is a possible
 system. Is it the system you mean?"


 Very sharp, Korvin told himself grimly. "It is," he said.


 "Then the government which reigns over several planets is supreme,"
 the Ruler said.


 "It is," Korvin said.


 "Who is it that governs?" the Ruler said.


 The key question had, at last, been asked. Korvin felt grateful that
 the logical Tr'en had determined to begin from the beginning, instead
 of going off after details of armament first; it saved a lot of time.


 "The answer to that question," Korvin said, "cannot be given to you."


 "Any question of fact has an answer," the Ruler snapped. "A paradox is
 not involved here; a government exists, and some being is the
 governor. Perhaps several beings share this task; perhaps machines do
 the work. But where there is a government, there is a governor. Is
 this agreed?"


 "Certainly," Korvin said. "It is completely obvious and true."


 "The planet from which you come is part of a system of planets which
 are governed, you have said," the Ruler went on.


 "True," Korvin said.


 "Then there is a governor for this system," the Ruler said.


 "True," Korvin said again.


 The ruler sighed gently. "Explain this governor to us," he said.


 Korvin shrugged. "The explanation cannot be given to you."


 The Ruler turned to a group of his experts and a short muttered
 conversation took place. At its end the Ruler turned his gaze back to
 Korvin. "Is the deficiency in you?" he said. "Are you in some way
 unable to describe this government?"


 "It can be described," Korvin said.


 "Then you will suffer unpleasant consequences if you describe it to
 us?" the Ruler went on.


 "I will not," Korvin said.


 It was the signal for another conference. With some satisfaction,
 Korvin noticed that the Tr'en were becoming slightly puzzled; they
 were no longer moving and speaking with calm assurance.


 The plan was taking hold.


 The Ruler had finished his conference. "You are attempting again to
 confuse us," he said.


 Korvin shook his head earnestly. "I am attempting," he said, "not to
 confuse you."


 "Then I ask for an answer," the Ruler said.


 "I request that I be allowed to ask a question," Korvin said.


 The Ruler hesitated, then nodded. "Ask it," he said. "We shall answer
 it if we see fit to do so."


 Korvin tried to look grateful. "Well, then," he said, "what is your
 government?"


 The Ruler beckoned to a heavy-set green being, who stepped forward
 from a knot of Tr'en, inclined his head in Korvin's direction, and
 began. "Our government is the only logical form of government," he
 said in a high, sweet tenor. "The Ruler orders all, and his subjects
 obey. In this way uniformity is gained, and this uniformity aids in
 the speed of possible action and in the weight of action. All Tr'en
 act instantly in the same manner. The Ruler is adopted by the previous
 Ruler; in this way we are assured of a common wisdom and a steady
 judgment."


 "You have heard our government defined," the Ruler said. "Now, you
 will define yours for us."


 Korvin shook his head. "If you insist," he said, "I'll try it. But you
 won't understand it."


 The Ruler frowned. "We shall understand," he said. "Begin. Who governs
 you?"


 "None," Korvin said.


 "But you are governed?"


 Korvin nodded. "Yes."


 "Then there is a governor," the Ruler insisted.


 "True," Korvin said. "But everyone is the governor."


 "Then there is no government," the Ruler said. "There is no single
 decision."


 "No," Korvin said equably, "there are many decisions binding on all."


 "Who makes them binding?" the Ruler asked. "Who forces you to accept
 these decisions? Some of them must be unfavorable to some beings?"


 "Many of them are unfavorable," Korvin said. "But we are not forced to
 accept them."


 "Do you act against your own interests?"


 Korvin shrugged. "Not knowingly," he said. The Ruler flashed a look at
 the technicians handling the lie-detector. Korvin turned to see their
 expression. They needed no words; the lie-detector was telling them,
 perfectly obviously, that he was speaking the truth. But the truth
 wasn't making any sense. "I told you you wouldn't understand it," he
 said.


 "It is a defect in your explanation," the Ruler almost snarled.


 "My explanation is as exact as it can be," he said.


 The Ruler breathed gustily. "Let us try something else," he said.
 "Everyone is the governor. Do you share a single mind? A racial mind
 has been theorized, though we have met with no examples—"


 "Neither have we," Korvin said. "We are all individuals, like
 yourselves."


 "But with no single ruler to form policy, to make decisions—"


 "We have no need of one," Korvin said calmly.


 "Ah," the Ruler said suddenly, as if he saw daylight ahead. "And why
 not?"


 "We call our form of government
democracy
," Korvin said. "It means
 the rule of the people. There is no need for another ruler."


 One of the experts piped up suddenly. "The beings themselves rule each
 other?" he said. "This is clearly impossible; for, no one being can
 have the force to compel acceptance of his commands. Without his
 force, there can be no effective rule."


 "That is our form of government," Korvin said.


 "You are lying," the expert said.


 One of the technicians chimed in: "The machine tells us—"


 "Then the machine is faulty," the expert said. "It will be corrected."


 Korvin wondered, as the technicians argued, how long they'd take
 studying the machine, before they realized it didn't have any defects
 to correct. He hoped it wasn't going to be too long; he could foresee
 another stretch of boredom coming. And, besides, he was getting
 homesick.


 It took three days—but boredom never really had a chance to set in.
 Korvin found himself the object of more attention than he had hoped
 for; one by one, the experts came to his cell, each with a different
 method of resolving the obvious contradictions in his statements.


 Some of them went away fuming. Others simply went away, puzzled.


 On the third day Korvin escaped.


 It wasn't very difficult; he hadn't thought it would be. Even the most
 logical of thinking beings has a subconscious as well as a conscious
 mind, and one of the ways of dealing with an insoluble problem is to
 make the problem disappear. There were only two ways of doing that,
 and killing the problem's main focus was a little more complicated.
 That couldn't be done by the subconscious mind; the conscious had to
 intervene somewhere. And it couldn't.


 Because that would mean recognizing, fully and consciously, that the
 problem
was
insoluble. And the Tr'en weren't capable of that sort of
 thinking.


 Korvin thanked his lucky stars that their genius had been restricted
 to the physical and mathematical. Any insight at all into the mental
 sciences would have given them the key to his existence, and his
 entire plan, within seconds.


 But, then, it was lack of that insight that had called for this
 particular plan. That, and the political structure of the Tr'en.


 The same lack of insight let the Tr'en subconscious work on his
 escape without any annoying distractions in the way of deep
 reflection. Someone left a door unlocked and a weapon nearby—all
 quite intent, Korvin was sure. Getting to the ship was a little more
 complicated, but presented no new problems; he was airborne, and then
 space-borne, inside of a few hours after leaving the cell.


 He set his course, relaxed, and cleared his mind. He had no psionic
 talents, but the men at Earth Central did; he couldn't receive
 messages, but he could send them. He sent one now.
Mission accomplished; the Tr'en aren't about to come
 marauding out into space too soon. They've been given food
 for thought—nice indigestible food that's going to stick in
 their craws until they finally manage to digest it. But they
 can't digest it and stay what they are; you've got to be
 democratic, to some extent, to understand the idea. What
 keeps us obeying laws we ourselves make? What keeps us
 obeying laws that make things inconvenient for us? Sheer
 self-interest, of course—but try to make a Tr'en see it!
With one government and one language, they just weren't
 equipped for translation. They were too efficient physically
 to try for the mental sciences at all. No mental sciences,
 no insight into my mind or their own—and that means no
 translation.
But—damn it—I wish I were home already.
I'm bored absolutely stiff!
THE END

Question:
Why did the Tr'en leave Korvin's door unlocked and a weapon nearby?
Options:
A: They were so caught up trying to figure out  Korvin's answers that they became somewhat careless in guarding him. 
B: Their subconscious knew that Korvin was an insoluble problem. This same subconscious led them to provide resources for his escape so they wouldn't have to deal with him anymore. 
C: They were tired of the Ruler's dictatorship and intentionally provided resources for Korvin's escape in hopes that he would help them overthrow the Ruler.  
D: After their interview with Korvin, they determined he was wasteful and confusing, but not a threat. In order to avoid another confusing interaction with him, they simply provided resources for his escape.

Do not add any extra words.\n\n\nExample:\nPassage:\n THE GIRL IN HIS MIND\nBy ROBERT F. YOUNG\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Worlds of Tomorrow April 1963\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\nEvery man's mind is a universe with countless\n\n places in which he can hide—even from himself!\nThe dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated\n version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7\n practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,\n it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted\n the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the\n nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was\n slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the\n shadows at the back of the room. \"Is she free?\" he asked.\n\n\n \"I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps.\"\n\n\n Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of\n love and lust\nQuestion:\nHow much time has passed between Blake's night with Eldoria and his search for Sabrina York in his mind-world?\nOptions:\nA: 7 years\nB: 10 hours\nC: 12 years\nD: 1 hour\nAnswer: B\n\n\nPassage:\n LOST\n\n IN\n\n TRANSLATION\nBy\nLARRY M.\n\n HARRIS\nIn language translation, you may get a literally accurate\n word-for-word translation ... but miss the meaning entirely. And in\n space-type translation ... the effect may be the same!\nIllustrated by Schoenherr\nThe cell had been put together more efficiently than any Korvin had\n ever been in. But that was only natural, he told himself sadly; the\n Tr'en were an efficient people. All the preliminary reports had agreed\n on that; their efficiency, as a matter of fact, was what had made\n Korvin's arrival a necessity. They were well into the atomic era, and\n were on the verge of developing space travel. Before long they'd be\n settling the other planets of their system, and then the nearer stars.\n Faster-than-light travel couldn't be far away, for the magnificently\n efficient physical scientists of the Tr'en—and that would mean, in\n the ordinary course of events, an invitation to join the Comity of\n Planets.\n\n\n An invitation, the Comity was sure, which the Tr'en would not accept.\n\n\n Korvin stretched out on the cell's single bunk, a rigid affair which\n was hardly meant for comfort, and sighed. He'd had three days of\n isolation, with nothing to do but explore the resources of his own\n mind. He'd tried some of the ancient Rhine experiments, but that was\n no good; he still didn't show any particular psi talents. He couldn't\n unlock the cell door with his unaided mind; he couldn't even alter the\n probability of a single dust-mote's Brownian path through the somewhat\n smelly air. Nor could he disappear from his cell and appear, as if by\n magic, several miles away near the slightly-damaged hulk of his ship,\n to the wonder and amazement of his Tr'en captors.\n\n\n He could do, as a matter of fact, precisely nothing. He wished quietly\n that the Tr'en had seen fit to give him a pack of cards, or a book, or\n even a folder of tourist pictures. The Wonders of Tr'en, according to\n all the advance reports, were likely to be pretty boring, but they'd\n have been better than nothing.\n\n\n In any decently-run jail, he told himself with indignation, there\n would at least have been other prisoners to talk to. But on Tr'en\n Korvin was all alone.\n\n\n True, every night the guards came in and gave him a concentrated\n lesson in the local language, but Korvin failed to get much pleasure\n out of that, being unconscious at the time. But now he was equipped to\n discuss almost anything from philosophy to plumbing, but there was\n nobody to discuss it with. He changed position on the bunk and stared\n at the walls. The Tr'en were efficient; there weren't even any\n imperfections in the smooth surface to distract him.\n\n\n He wasn't tired and he wasn't hungry; his captors had left him with a\n full stock of food concentrates.\n\n\n But he was almightily bored, and about ready to tell anything to\n anyone, just for the chance at a little conversation.\n\n\n As he reached this dismal conclusion, the cell door opened. Korvin got\n up off the bunk in a hurry and spun around to face his visitor.\n\n\n The Tr'en was tall, and slightly green.\n\n\n He looked, as all the Tr'en did, vaguely humanoid—that is, if you\n don't bother to examine him closely. Life in the universe appeared to\n be rigidly limited to humanoid types on oxygen planets; Korvin didn't\n know why, and neither did anybody else. There were a lot of theories,\n but none that accounted for all the facts satisfactorily. Korvin\n really didn't care about it; it was none of his business.\n\n\n The Tr'en regarded him narrowly through catlike pupils. \"You are\n Korvin,\" he said.\n\n\n It was a ritual, Korvin had learned. \"You are of the Tr'en,\" he\n replied. The green being nodded.\n\n\n \"I am Didyak of the Tr'en,\" he said. Amenities over with, he relaxed\n slightly—but no more than slightly—and came into the cell, closing\n the door behind him. Korvin thought of jumping the Tr'en, but decided\n quickly against it. He was a captive, and it was unwise to assume that\n his captors had no more resources than the ones he saw: a small\n translucent pistollike affair in a holster at the Tr'en's side, and a\n small knife in a sheath at the belt. Those Korvin could deal with; but\n there might be almost anything else hidden and ready to fire on him.\n\n\n \"What do you want with me?\" Korvin said. The Tr'en speech—apparently\n there was only one language on the planet—was stiff and slightly\n awkward, but easily enough learned under drug hypnosis; it was the\n most rigorously logical construction of its kind Korvin had ever come\n across. It reminded him of some of the mathematical metalanguages he'd\n dealt with back on Earth, in training; but it was more closely and\n carefully constructed than even those marvels.\n\n\n \"I want nothing with you,\" Didyak said, leaning against the\n door-frame. \"You have other questions?\"\n\n\n Korvin sighed. \"What are you doing here, then?\" he asked. As\n conversation, it wasn't very choice; but it was, he admitted, better\n than solitude.\n\n\n \"I am leaning against the door,\" Didyak said. The Tr'en literalist\n approach to the smallest problems of everyday living was a little hard\n to get the hang of, Korvin told himself bitterly. He thought for a\n second.\n\n\n \"Why did you come to me?\" he said at last.\n\n\n Didyak beamed at him. The sight was remarkably unpleasant, involving\n as it did the disclosure of the Tr'en fifty-eight teeth, mostly\n pointed. Korvin stared back impassively. \"I have been ordered to come\n to you,\" Didyak said, \"by the Ruler. The Ruler wishes to talk with\n you.\"\n\n\n It wasn't quite \"talk\"; that was a general word in the Tr'en language,\n and Didyak had used a specific meaning, roughly: \"gain information\n from, by peaceful and vocal means.\" Korvin filed it away for future\n reference. \"Why did the Ruler not come to me?\" Korvin asked.\n\n\n \"The Ruler is the Ruler,\" Didyak said, slightly discomfited. \"You are\n to go to him. Such is his command.\"\n\n\n Korvin shrugged, sighed and smoothed back his hair. \"I obey the\n command of the Ruler,\" he said—another ritual. Everybody obeyed the\n command of the Ruler. If you didn't, you never had a second chance to\n try.\n\n\n But Korvin meant exactly what he'd said. He was going to obey the\n commands of the Ruler of the Tr'en—and remove the Tr'en threat from\n the rest of the galaxy forever.\n\n\n That, after all, was his job.\nThe Room of the Ruler was large, square and excessively brown. The\n walls were dark-brown, the furnishings—a single great chair, several\n kneeling-benches and a small table near the chair—were light-brown,\n of some metallic substance, and even the drapes were tan. It was,\n Korvin decided, much too much of a bad idea, even when the color\n contrast of the Tr'en themselves were figured in.\n\n\n The Ruler himself, a Tr'en over seven feet tall and correspondingly\n broad, sat in the great chair, his four fingers tapping gently on the\n table near him, staring at Korvin and his guards. The guards stood on\n either side of their captive, looking as impassive as jade statues,\n six and a half feet high.\n\n\n Korvin wasn't attempting to escape. He wasn't pleading with the Ruler.\n He wasn't defying the Ruler, either. He was just answering questions.\n\n\n The Tr'en liked to have everything clear. They were a logical race.\n The Ruler had started with Korvin's race, his name, his sex—if\n any—and whether or not his appearance were normal for humanity.\n\n\n Korvin was answering the last question. \"Some men are larger than I\n am,\" he said, \"and some are smaller.\"\n\n\n \"Within what limits?\"\n\n\n Korvin shrugged. \"Some are over eight feet tall,\" he said, \"and others\n under four feet.\" He used the Tr'en measurement scale, of course; it\n didn't seem necessary, though, to mention that both extremes of height\n were at the circus-freak level. \"Then there is a group of humans,\" he\n went on, \"who are never more than a foot and a half in height, and\n usually less than that—approximately nine or ten inches. We call\n these\nchildren\n,\" he volunteered helpfully.\n\n\n \"Approximately?\" the Ruler growled. \"We ask for precision here,\" he\n said. \"We are scientific men. We are exact.\"\n\n\n Korvin nodded hurriedly. \"Our race is more ... more approximate,\" he\n said apologetically.\n\n\n \"Slipshod,\" the Ruler muttered.\n\n\n \"Undoubtedly,\" Korvin agreed politely. \"I'll try to do the best I can\n for you.\"\n\n\n \"You will answer my questions,\" the Ruler said, \"with exactitude.\" He\n paused, frowning slightly. \"You landed your ship on this planet,\" he\n went on. \"Why?\"\n\n\n \"My job required it,\" Korvin said.\n\n\n \"A clumsy lie,\" the Ruler said. \"The ship crashed; our examinations\n prove that beyond any doubt.\"\n\n\n \"True,\" Korvin said.\n\n\n \"And it is your job to crash your ship?\" the Ruler said. \"Wasteful.\"\n\n\n Korvin shrugged again. \"What I say is true,\" he announced. \"Do you\n have tests for such matters?\"\n\n\n \"We do,\" the Ruler told him. \"We are an exact and a scientific race. A\n machine for the testing of truth has been adjusted to your physiology.\n It will be attached to you.\"\n\n\n Korvin looked around and saw it coming through the door, pushed by two\n technicians. It was large and squat and metallic, and it had wheels,\n dials, blinking lights, tubes and wires, and a seat with armrests and\n straps. It was obviously a form of lie-detector—and Korvin felt\n himself marveling again at this race. Earth science had nothing to\n match their enormous command of the physical universe; adapting a\n hypnopædic language-course to an alien being so quickly had been\n wonder enough, but adapting the perilously delicate mechanisms that\n necessarily made up any lie-detector machinery was almost a miracle.\n The Tr'en, under other circumstances, would have been a valuable\n addition to the Comity of Nations.\n\n\n Being what they were, though, they could only be a menace. And\n Korvin's appreciation of the size of that menace was growing hourly.\n\n\n He hoped the lie-detector had been adjusted correctly. If it showed\n him telling an untruth, he wasn't likely to live long, and his\n job—not to mention the strongest personal inclinations—demanded most\n strongly that he stay alive.\n\n\n He swallowed hard. But when the technicians forced him down into the\n seat, buckled straps around him, attached wires and electrodes and\n elastic bands to him at appropriate places and tightened some final\n screws, he made no resistance.\n\n\n \"We shall test the machine,\" the Ruler said. \"In what room are you?\"\n\n\n \"In the Room of the Ruler,\" Korvin said equably.\n\n\n \"Are you standing or sitting?\"\n\n\n \"I am sitting,\" Korvin said.\n\n\n \"Are you a\nchulad\n?\" the Ruler asked. A\nchulad\nwas a small native\n pet, Korvin knew, something like a greatly magnified deathwatch\n beetle.\n\n\n \"I am not,\" he said.\nThe Ruler looked to his technicians for a signal, and nodded on\n receiving it. \"You will tell an untruth now,\" he said. \"Are you\n standing or sitting?\"\n\n\n \"I am standing,\" Korvin said.\n\n\n The technicians gave another signal. The Ruler looked, in his frowning\n manner, reasonably satisfied. \"The machine,\" he announced, \"has been\n adjusted satisfactorily to your physiology. The questioning will now\n continue.\"\n\n\n Korvin swallowed again. The test hadn't really seemed extensive enough\n to him. But, after all, the Tr'en knew their business, better than\n anyone else could know it. They had the technique and the logic and\n the training.\n\n\n He hoped they were right.\n\n\n The Ruler was frowning at him. Korvin did his best to look receptive.\n \"Why did you land your ship on this planet?\" the Ruler said.\n\n\n \"My job required it,\" Korvin said.\n\n\n The Ruler nodded. \"Your job is to crash your ship,\" he said. \"It is\n wasteful but the machines tell me it is true. Very well, then; we\n shall find out more about your job. Was the crash intentional?\"\n\n\n Korvin looked sober. \"Yes,\" he said.\n\n\n The Ruler blinked. \"Very well,\" he said. \"Was your job ended when the\n ship crashed?\" The Tr'en word, of course, wasn't\nended\n, nor did it\n mean exactly that. As nearly as Korvin could make out, it meant\n \"disposed of for all time.\"\n\n\n \"No,\" he said.\n\n\n \"What else does your job entail?\" the Ruler said.\n\n\n Korvin decided to throw his first spoke into the wheel. \"Staying\n alive.\"\n\n\n The Ruler roared. \"Do not waste time with the obvious!\" he shouted.\n \"Do not try to trick us; we are a logical and scientific race! Answer\n correctly.\"\n\n\n \"I have told the truth,\" Korvin said.\n\n\n \"But it is not—not the truth we want,\" the Ruler said.\n\n\n Korvin shrugged. \"I replied to your question,\" he said. \"I did not\n know that there was more than one kind of truth. Surely the truth is\n the truth, just as the Ruler is the Ruler?\"\n\n\n \"I—\" The Ruler stopped himself in mid-roar. \"You try to confuse the\n Ruler,\" he said at last, in an approximation of his usual one. \"But\n the Ruler will not be confused. We have experts in matters of\n logic\"—the Tr'en word seemed to mean\nright-saying\n—\"who will advise\n the Ruler. They will be called.\"\n\n\n Korvin's guards were standing around doing nothing of importance now\n that their captor was strapped down in the lie-detector. The Ruler\n gestured and they went out the door in a hurry.\n\n\n The Ruler looked down at Korvin. \"You will find that you cannot trick\n us,\" he said. \"You will find that such fiddling\"—\nchulad-like\nKorvin\n translated—\"attempts will get you nowhere.\"\n\n\n Korvin devoutly hoped so.\nThe experts in logic arrived shortly, and in no uncertain terms Korvin\n was given to understand that logical paradox was not going to confuse\n anybody on the planet. The barber who did, or didn't, shave himself,\n the secretary of the club whose members were secretaries, Achilles and\n the tortoise, and all the other lovely paradox-models scattered around\n were so much primer material for the Tr'en. \"They can be treated\n mathematically,\" one of the experts, a small emerald-green being, told\n Korvin thinly. \"Of course, you would not understand the mathematics.\n But that is not important. You need only understand that we cannot be\n confused by such means.\"\n\n\n \"Good,\" Korvin said.\n\n\n The experts blinked. \"Good?\" he said.\n\n\n \"Naturally,\" Korvin said in a friendly tone.\n\n\n The expert frowned horribly, showing all of his teeth. Korvin did his\n best not to react. \"Your plan is a failure,\" the expert said, \"and you\n call this a good thing. You can mean only that your plan is different\n from the one we are occupied with.\"\n\n\n \"True,\" Korvin said.\n\n\n There was a short silence. The expert beamed. He examined the\n indicators of the lie-detector with great care. \"What is your plan?\"\n he said at last, in a conspiratorial whisper.\n\n\n \"To answer your questions, truthfully and logically,\" Korvin said.\n\n\n The silence this time was even longer.\n\n\n \"The machine says that you tell the truth,\" the experts said at last,\n in a awed tone. \"Thus, you must be a traitor to your native planet.\n You must want us to conquer your planet, and have come here secretly\n to aid us.\"\n\n\n Korvin was very glad that wasn't a question. It was, after all, the\n only logical deduction.\n\n\n But it happened to be wrong.\n\"The name of your planet is Earth?\" the Ruler asked. A few minutes had\n passed; the experts were clustered around the single chair. Korvin was\n still strapped to the machine; a logical race makes use of a traitor,\n but a logical race does not trust him.\n\n\n \"Sometimes,\" Korvin said.\n\n\n \"It has other names?\" the Ruler said.\n\n\n \"It has no name,\" Korvin said truthfully. The Tr'en idiom was like the\n Earthly one; and certainly a planet had no name. People attached names\n to it, that was all. It had none of its own.\n\n\n \"Yet you call it Earth?\" the Ruler said.\n\n\n \"I do,\" Korvin said, \"for convenience.\"\n\n\n \"Do you know its location?\" the Ruler said.\n\n\n \"Not with exactitude,\" Korvin said.\n\n\n There was a stir. \"But you can find it again,\" the Ruler said.\n\n\n \"I can,\" Korvin said.\n\n\n \"And you will tell us about it?\" the Ruler went on.\n\n\n \"I will,\" Korvin said, \"so far as I am able.\"\n\n\n \"We will wish to know about weapons,\" the Ruler said, \"and about plans\n and fortifications. But we must first know of the manner of decision\n on this planet. Is your planet joined with others in a government or\n does it exist alone?\"\n\n\n Korvin nearly smiled. \"Both,\" he said.\n\n\n A short silence was broken by one of the attendant experts. \"We have\n theorized that an underling may be permitted to make some of his own\n decisions, leaving only the more extensive ones for the master. This\n seems to us inefficient and liable to error, yet it is a possible\n system. Is it the system you mean?\"\n\n\n Very sharp, Korvin told himself grimly. \"It is,\" he said.\n\n\n \"Then the government which reigns over several planets is supreme,\"\n the Ruler said.\n\n\n \"It is,\" Korvin said.\n\n\n \"Who is it that governs?\" the Ruler said.\n\n\n The key question had, at last, been asked. Korvin felt grateful that\n the logical Tr'en had determined to begin from the beginning, instead\n of going off after details of armament first; it saved a lot of time.\n\n\n \"The answer to that question,\" Korvin said, \"cannot be given to you.\"\n\n\n \"Any question of fact has an answer,\" the Ruler snapped. \"A paradox is\n not involved here; a government exists, and some being is the\n governor. Perhaps several beings share this task; perhaps machines do\n the work. But where there is a government, there is a governor. Is\n this agreed?\"\n\n\n \"Certainly,\" Korvin said. \"It is completely obvious and true.\"\n\n\n \"The planet from which you come is part of a system of planets which\n are governed, you have said,\" the Ruler went on.\n\n\n \"True,\" Korvin said.\n\n\n \"Then there is a governor for this system,\" the Ruler said.\n\n\n \"True,\" Korvin said again.\n\n\n The ruler sighed gently. \"Explain this governor to us,\" he said.\n\n\n Korvin shrugged. \"The explanation cannot be given to you.\"\n\n\n The Ruler turned to a group of his experts and a short muttered\n conversation took place. At its end the Ruler turned his gaze back to\n Korvin. \"Is the deficiency in you?\" he said. \"Are you in some way\n unable to describe this government?\"\n\n\n \"It can be described,\" Korvin said.\n\n\n \"Then you will suffer unpleasant consequences if you describe it to\n us?\" the Ruler went on.\n\n\n \"I will not,\" Korvin said.\n\n\n It was the signal for another conference. With some satisfaction,\n Korvin noticed that the Tr'en were becoming slightly puzzled; they\n were no longer moving and speaking with calm assurance.\n\n\n The plan was taking hold.\n\n\n The Ruler had finished his conference. \"You are attempting again to\n confuse us,\" he said.\n\n\n Korvin shook his head earnestly. \"I am attempting,\" he said, \"not to\n confuse you.\"\n\n\n \"Then I ask for an answer,\" the Ruler said.\n\n\n \"I request that I be allowed to ask a question,\" Korvin said.\n\n\n The Ruler hesitated, then nodded. \"Ask it,\" he said. \"We shall answer\n it if we see fit to do so.\"\n\n\n Korvin tried to look grateful. \"Well, then,\" he said, \"what is your\n government?\"\n\n\n The Ruler beckoned to a heavy-set green being, who stepped forward\n from a knot of Tr'en, inclined his head in Korvin's direction, and\n began. \"Our government is the only logical form of government,\" he\n said in a high, sweet tenor. \"The Ruler orders all, and his subjects\n obey. In this way uniformity is gained, and this uniformity aids in\n the speed of possible action and in the weight of action. All Tr'en\n act instantly in the same manner. The Ruler is adopted by the previous\n Ruler; in this way we are assured of a common wisdom and a steady\n judgment.\"\n\n\n \"You have heard our government defined,\" the Ruler said. \"Now, you\n will define yours for us.\"\n\n\n Korvin shook his head. \"If you insist,\" he said, \"I'll try it. But you\n won't understand it.\"\n\n\n The Ruler frowned. \"We shall understand,\" he said. \"Begin. Who governs\n you?\"\n\n\n \"None,\" Korvin said.\n\n\n \"But you are governed?\"\n\n\n Korvin nodded. \"Yes.\"\n\n\n \"Then there is a governor,\" the Ruler insisted.\n\n\n \"True,\" Korvin said. \"But everyone is the governor.\"\n\n\n \"Then there is no government,\" the Ruler said. \"There is no single\n decision.\"\n\n\n \"No,\" Korvin said equably, \"there are many decisions binding on all.\"\n\n\n \"Who makes them binding?\" the Ruler asked. \"Who forces you to accept\n these decisions? Some of them must be unfavorable to some beings?\"\n\n\n \"Many of them are unfavorable,\" Korvin said. \"But we are not forced to\n accept them.\"\n\n\n \"Do you act against your own interests?\"\n\n\n Korvin shrugged. \"Not knowingly,\" he said. The Ruler flashed a look at\n the technicians handling the lie-detector. Korvin turned to see their\n expression. They needed no words; the lie-detector was telling them,\n perfectly obviously, that he was speaking the truth. But the truth\n wasn't making any sense. \"I told you you wouldn't understand it,\" he\n said.\n\n\n \"It is a defect in your explanation,\" the Ruler almost snarled.\n\n\n \"My explanation is as exact as it can be,\" he said.\n\n\n The Ruler breathed gustily. \"Let us try something else,\" he said.\n \"Everyone is the governor. Do you share a single mind? A racial mind\n has been theorized, though we have met with no examples—\"\n\n\n \"Neither have we,\" Korvin said. \"We are all individuals, like\n yourselves.\"\n\n\n \"But with no single ruler to form policy, to make decisions—\"\n\n\n \"We have no need of one,\" Korvin said calmly.\n\n\n \"Ah,\" the Ruler said suddenly, as if he saw daylight ahead. \"And why\n not?\"\n\n\n \"We call our form of government\ndemocracy\n,\" Korvin said. \"It means\n the rule of the people. There is no need for another ruler.\"\n\n\n One of the experts piped up suddenly. \"The beings themselves rule each\n other?\" he said. \"This is clearly impossible; for, no one being can\n have the force to compel acceptance of his commands. Without his\n force, there can be no effective rule.\"\n\n\n \"That is our form of government,\" Korvin said.\n\n\n \"You are lying,\" the expert said.\n\n\n One of the technicians chimed in: \"The machine tells us—\"\n\n\n \"Then the machine is faulty,\" the expert said. \"It will be corrected.\"\n\n\n Korvin wondered, as the technicians argued, how long they'd take\n studying the machine, before they realized it didn't have any defects\n to correct. He hoped it wasn't going to be too long; he could foresee\n another stretch of boredom coming. And, besides, he was getting\n homesick.\n\n\n It took three days—but boredom never really had a chance to set in.\n Korvin found himself the object of more attention than he had hoped\n for; one by one, the experts came to his cell, each with a different\n method of resolving the obvious contradictions in his statements.\n\n\n Some of them went away fuming. Others simply went away, puzzled.\n\n\n On the third day Korvin escaped.\n\n\n It wasn't very difficult; he hadn't thought it would be. Even the most\n logical of thinking beings has a subconscious as well as a conscious\n mind, and one of the ways of dealing with an insoluble problem is to\n make the problem disappear. There were only two ways of doing that,\n and killing the problem's main focus was a little more complicated.\n That couldn't be done by the subconscious mind; the conscious had to\n intervene somewhere. And it couldn't.\n\n\n Because that would mean recognizing, fully and consciously, that the\n problem\nwas\ninsoluble. And the Tr'en weren't capable of that sort of\n thinking.\n\n\n Korvin thanked his lucky stars that their genius had been restricted\n to the physical and mathematical. Any insight at all into the mental\n sciences would have given them the key to his existence, and his\n entire plan, within seconds.\n\n\n But, then, it was lack of that insight that had called for this\n particular plan. That, and the political structure of the Tr'en.\n\n\n The same lack of insight let the Tr'en subconscious work on his\n escape without any annoying distractions in the way of deep\n reflection. Someone left a door unlocked and a weapon nearby—all\n quite intent, Korvin was sure. Getting to the ship was a little more\n complicated, but presented no new problems; he was airborne, and then\n space-borne, inside of a few hours after leaving the cell.\n\n\n He set his course, relaxed, and cleared his mind. He had no psionic\n talents, but the men at Earth Central did; he couldn't receive\n messages, but he could send them. He sent one now.\nMission accomplished; the Tr'en aren't about to come\n marauding out into space too soon. They've been given food\n for thought—nice indigestible food that's going to stick in\n their craws until they finally manage to digest it. But they\n can't digest it and stay what they are; you've got to be\n democratic, to some extent, to understand the idea. What\n keeps us obeying laws we ourselves make? What keeps us\n obeying laws that make things inconvenient for us? Sheer\n self-interest, of course—but try to make a Tr'en see it!\nWith one government and one language, they just weren't\n equipped for translation. They were too efficient physically\n to try for the mental sciences at all. No mental sciences,\n no insight into my mind or their own—and that means no\n translation.\nBut—damn it—I wish I were home already.\nI'm bored absolutely stiff!\nTHE END\n\nQuestion:\nWhy did the Tr'en leave Korvin's door unlocked and a weapon nearby?\nOptions:\nA: They were so caught up trying to figure out  Korvin's answers that they became somewhat careless in guarding him. \nB: Their subconscious knew that Korvin was an insoluble problem. This same subconscious led them to provide resources for his escape so they wouldn't have to deal with him anymore. \nC: They were tired of the Ruler's dictatorship and intentionally provided resources for Korvin's escape in hopes that he would help them overthrow the Ruler.  \nD: After their interview with Korvin, they determined he was wasteful and confusing, but not a threat. In order to avoid another confusing interaction with him, they simply provided resources for his escape. \nAnswer:", "role": "user", "name": null, "raw": false}], "model": "rwkv", "stream": false, "stop": ["\n\nUser", "\n\nQuestion", "\n\nQ", "\n\nHuman", "\n\nBob", "\n\nAssistant", "\n\nAnswer", "\n\nA", "\n\nBot", "\n\nAlice", "\n\nObservation", "\n\nUser", "\n\nAss"], "tools": null, "tool_choice": "auto", "user_name": null, "assistant_name": null, "system_name": null, "presystem": false}

Do not add any extra words.\\n\\n\\nExample:\\nPassage:\\n THE GIRL IN HIS MIND\\nBy ROBERT F. YOUNG\\n\\n\\n [Transcriber\'s Note: This etext was produced from\\n\\n Worlds of Tomorrow April 1963\\n\\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\\n\\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\\nEvery man\'s mind is a universe with countless\\n\\n places in which he can hide\\u2014even from himself!\\nThe dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated\\n version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7\\n practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,\\n it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted\\n the chocoletto girl\'s entire costume put her but one degree above the\\n nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake\'s voice was\\n slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the\\n shadows at the back of the room. \\"Is she free?\\" he asked.\\n\\n\\n \\"I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps.\\"\\n\\n\\n Blake resumed watching. The girl\'s movements were a delicate blend of\\n love and lust\\nQuestion:\\nHow much time has passed between Blake\'s night with Eldoria and his search for Sabrina York in his mind-world?\\nOptions:\\nA: 7 years\\nB: 10 hours\\nC: 12 years\\nD: 1 hour\\nAnswer: B\\n\\n\\nPassage:\\n LOST\\n\\n IN\\n\\n TRANSLATION\\nBy\\nLARRY M.\\n\\n HARRIS\\nIn language translation, you may get a literally accurate\\n word-for-word translation ... but miss the meaning entirely. And in\\n space-type translation ... the effect may be the same!\\nIllustrated by Schoenherr\\nThe cell had been put together more efficiently than any Korvin had\\n ever been in. But that was only natural, he told himself sadly; the\\n Tr\'en were an efficient people. All the preliminary reports had agreed\\n on that; their efficiency, as a matter of fact, was what had made\\n Korvin\'s arrival a necessity. They were well into the atomic era, and\\n were on the verge of developing space travel. Before long they\'d be\\n settling the other planets of their system, and then the nearer stars.\\n Faster-than-light travel couldn\'t be far away, for the magnificently\\n efficient physical scientists of the Tr\'en\\u2014and that would mean, in\\n the ordinary course of events, an invitation to join the Comity of\\n Planets.\\n\\n\\n An invitation, the Comity was sure, which the Tr\'en would not accept.\\n\\n\\n Korvin stretched out on the cell\'s single bunk, a rigid affair which\\n was hardly meant for comfort, and sighed. He\'d had three days of\\n isolation, with nothing to do but explore the resources of his own\\n mind. He\'d tried some of the ancient Rhine experiments, but that was\\n no good; he still didn\'t show any particular psi talents. He couldn\'t\\n unlock the cell door with his unaided mind; he couldn\'t even alter the\\n probability of a single dust-mote\'s Brownian path through the somewhat\\n smelly air. Nor could he disappear from his cell and appear, as if by\\n magic, several miles away near the slightly-damaged hulk of his ship,\\n to the wonder and amazement of his Tr\'en captors.\\n\\n\\n He could do, as a matter of fact, precisely nothing. He wished quietly\\n that the Tr\'en had seen fit to give him a pack of cards, or a book, or\\n even a folder of tourist pictures. The Wonders of Tr\'en, according to\\n all the advance reports, were likely to be pretty boring, but they\'d\\n have been better than nothing.\\n\\n\\n In any decently-run jail, he told himself with indignation, there\\n would at least have been other prisoners to talk to. But on Tr\'en\\n Korvin was all alone.\\n\\n\\n True, every night the guards came in and gave him a concentrated\\n lesson in the local language, but Korvin failed to get much pleasure\\n out of that, being unconscious at the time. But now he was equipped to\\n discuss almost anything from philosophy to plumbing, but there was\\n nobody to discuss it with. He changed position on the bunk and stared\\n at the walls. The Tr\'en were efficient; there weren\'t even any\\n imperfections in the smooth surface to distract him.\\n\\n\\n He wasn\'t tired and he wasn\'t hungry; his captors had left him with a\\n full stock of food concentrates.\\n\\n\\n But he was almightily bored, and about ready to tell anything to\\n anyone, just for the chance at a little conversation.\\n\\n\\n As he reached this dismal conclusion, the cell door opened. Korvin got\\n up off the bunk in a hurry and spun around to face his visitor.\\n\\n\\n The Tr\'en was tall, and slightly green.\\n\\n\\n He looked, as all the Tr\'en did, vaguely humanoid\\u2014that is, if you\\n don\'t bother to examine him closely. Life in the universe appeared to\\n be rigidly limited to humanoid types on oxygen planets; Korvin didn\'t\\n know why, and neither did anybody else. There were a lot of theories,\\n but none that accounted for all the facts satisfactorily. Korvin\\n really didn\'t care about it; it was none of his business.\\n\\n\\n The Tr\'en regarded him narrowly through catlike pupils. \\"You are\\n Korvin,\\" he said.\\n\\n\\n It was a ritual, Korvin had learned. \\"You are of the Tr\'en,\\" he\\n replied. The green being nodded.\\n\\n\\n \\"I am Didyak of the Tr\'en,\\" he said. Amenities over with, he relaxed\\n slightly\\u2014but no more than slightly\\u2014and came into the cell, closing\\n the door behind him. Korvin thought of jumping the Tr\'en, but decided\\n quickly against it. He was a captive, and it was unwise to assume that\\n his captors had no more resources than the ones he saw: a small\\n translucent pistollike affair in a holster at the Tr\'en\'s side, and a\\n small knife in a sheath at the belt. Those Korvin could deal with; but\\n there might be almost anything else hidden and ready to fire on him.\\n\\n\\n \\"What do you want with me?\\" Korvin said. The Tr\'en speech\\u2014apparently\\n there was only one language on the planet\\u2014was stiff and slightly\\n awkward, but easily enough learned under drug hypnosis; it was the\\n most rigorously logical construction of its kind Korvin had ever come\\n across. It reminded him of some of the mathematical metalanguages he\'d\\n dealt with back on Earth, in training; but it was more closely and\\n carefully constructed than even those marvels.\\n\\n\\n \\"I want nothing with you,\\" Didyak said, leaning against the\\n door-frame. \\"You have other questions?\\"\\n\\n\\n Korvin sighed. \\"What are you doing here, then?\\" he asked. As\\n conversation, it wasn\'t very choice; but it was, he admitted, better\\n than solitude.\\n\\n\\n \\"I am leaning against the door,\\" Didyak said. The Tr\'en literalist\\n approach to the smallest problems of everyday living was a little hard\\n to get the hang of, Korvin told himself bitterly. He thought for a\\n second.\\n\\n\\n \\"Why did you come to me?\\" he said at last.\\n\\n\\n Didyak beamed at him. The sight was remarkably unpleasant, involving\\n as it did the disclosure of the Tr\'en fifty-eight teeth, mostly\\n pointed. Korvin stared back impassively. \\"I have been ordered to come\\n to you,\\" Didyak said, \\"by the Ruler. The Ruler wishes to talk with\\n you.\\"\\n\\n\\n It wasn\'t quite \\"talk\\"; that was a general word in the Tr\'en language,\\n and Didyak had used a specific meaning, roughly: \\"gain information\\n from, by peaceful and vocal means.\\" Korvin filed it away for future\\n reference. \\"Why did the Ruler not come to me?\\" Korvin asked.\\n\\n\\n \\"The Ruler is the Ruler,\\" Didyak said, slightly discomfited. \\"You are\\n to go to him. Such is his command.\\"\\n\\n\\n Korvin shrugged, sighed and smoothed back his hair. \\"I obey the\\n command of the Ruler,\\" he said\\u2014another ritual. Everybody obeyed the\\n command of the Ruler. If you didn\'t, you never had a second chance to\\n try.\\n\\n\\n But Korvin meant exactly what he\'d said. He was going to obey the\\n commands of the Ruler of the Tr\'en\\u2014and remove the Tr\'en threat from\\n the rest of the galaxy forever.\\n\\n\\n That, after all, was his job.\\nThe Room of the Ruler was large, square and excessively brown. The\\n walls were dark-brown, the furnishings\\u2014a single great chair, several\\n kneeling-benches and a small table near the chair\\u2014were light-brown,\\n of some metallic substance, and even the drapes were tan. It was,\\n Korvin decided, much too much of a bad idea, even when the color\\n contrast of the Tr\'en themselves were figured in.\\n\\n\\n The Ruler himself, a Tr\'en over seven feet tall and correspondingly\\n broad, sat in the great chair, his four fingers tapping gently on the\\n table near him, staring at Korvin and his guards. The guards stood on\\n either side of their captive, looking as impassive as jade statues,\\n six and a half feet high.\\n\\n\\n Korvin wasn\'t attempting to escape. He wasn\'t pleading with the Ruler.\\n He wasn\'t defying the Ruler, either. He was just answering questions.\\n\\n\\n The Tr\'en liked to have everything clear. They were a logical race.\\n The Ruler had started with Korvin\'s race, his name, his sex\\u2014if\\n any\\u2014and whether or not his appearance were normal for humanity.\\n\\n\\n Korvin was answering the last question. \\"Some men are larger than I\\n am,\\" he said, \\"and some are smaller.\\"\\n\\n\\n \\"Within what limits?\\"\\n\\n\\n Korvin shrugged. \\"Some are over eight feet tall,\\" he said, \\"and others\\n under four feet.\\" He used the Tr\'en measurement scale, of course; it\\n didn\'t seem necessary, though, to mention that both extremes of height\\n were at the circus-freak level. \\"Then there is a group of humans,\\" he\\n went on, \\"who are never more than a foot and a half in height, and\\n usually less than that\\u2014approximately nine or ten inches. We call\\n these\\nchildren\\n,\\" he volunteered helpfully.\\n\\n\\n \\"Approximately?\\" the Ruler growled. \\"We ask for precision here,\\" he\\n said. \\"We are scientific men. We are exact.\\"\\n\\n\\n Korvin nodded hurriedly. \\"Our race is more ... more approximate,\\" he\\n said apologetically.\\n\\n\\n \\"Slipshod,\\" the Ruler muttered.\\n\\n\\n \\"Undoubtedly,\\" Korvin agreed politely. \\"I\'ll try to do the best I can\\n for you.\\"\\n\\n\\n \\"You will answer my questions,\\" the Ruler said, \\"with exactitude.\\" He\\n paused, frowning slightly. \\"You landed your ship on this planet,\\" he\\n went on. \\"Why?\\"\\n\\n\\n \\"My job required it,\\" Korvin said.\\n\\n\\n \\"A clumsy lie,\\" the Ruler said. \\"The ship crashed; our examinations\\n prove that beyond any doubt.\\"\\n\\n\\n \\"True,\\" Korvin said.\\n\\n\\n \\"And it is your job to crash your ship?\\" the Ruler said. \\"Wasteful.\\"\\n\\n\\n Korvin shrugged again. \\"What I say is true,\\" he announced. \\"Do you\\n have tests for such matters?\\"\\n\\n\\n \\"We do,\\" the Ruler told him. \\"We are an exact and a scientific race. A\\n machine for the testing of truth has been adjusted to your physiology.\\n It will be attached to you.\\"\\n\\n\\n Korvin looked around and saw it coming through the door, pushed by two\\n technicians. It was large and squat and metallic, and it had wheels,\\n dials, blinking lights, tubes and wires, and a seat with armrests and\\n straps. It was obviously a form of lie-detector\\u2014and Korvin felt\\n himself marveling again at this race. Earth science had nothing to\\n match their enormous command of the physical universe; adapting a\\n hypnop\\u00e6dic language-course to an alien being so quickly had been\\n wonder enough, but adapting the perilously delicate mechanisms that\\n necessarily made up any lie-detector machinery was almost a miracle.\\n The Tr\'en, under other circumstances, would have been a valuable\\n addition to the Comity of Nations.\\n\\n\\n Being what they were, though, they could only be a menace. And\\n Korvin\'s appreciation of the size of that menace was growing hourly.\\n\\n\\n He hoped the lie-detector had been adjusted correctly. If it showed\\n him telling an untruth, he wasn\'t likely to live long, and his\\n job\\u2014not to mention the strongest personal inclinations\\u2014demanded most\\n strongly that he stay alive.\\n\\n\\n He swallowed hard. But when the technicians forced him down into the\\n seat, buckled straps around him, attached wires and electrodes and\\n elastic bands to him at appropriate places and tightened some final\\n screws, he made no resistance.\\n\\n\\n \\"We shall test the machine,\\" the Ruler said. \\"In what room are you?\\"\\n\\n\\n \\"In the Room of the Ruler,\\" Korvin said equably.\\n\\n\\n \\"Are you standing or sitting?\\"\\n\\n\\n \\"I am sitting,\\" Korvin said.\\n\\n\\n \\"Are you a\\nchulad\\n?\\" the Ruler asked. A\\nchulad\\nwas a small native\\n pet, Korvin knew, something like a greatly magnified deathwatch\\n beetle.\\n\\n\\n \\"I am not,\\" he said.\\nThe Ruler looked to his technicians for a signal, and nodded on\\n receiving it. \\"You will tell an untruth now,\\" he said. \\"Are you\\n standing or sitting?\\"\\n\\n\\n \\"I am standing,\\" Korvin said.\\n\\n\\n The technicians gave another signal. The Ruler looked, in his frowning\\n manner, reasonably satisfied. \\"The machine,\\" he announced, \\"has been\\n adjusted satisfactorily to your physiology. The questioning will now\\n continue.\\"\\n\\n\\n Korvin swallowed again. The test hadn\'t really seemed extensive enough\\n to him. But, after all, the Tr\'en knew their business, better than\\n anyone else could know it. They had the technique and the logic and\\n the training.\\n\\n\\n He hoped they were right.\\n\\n\\n The Ruler was frowning at him. Korvin did his best to look receptive.\\n \\"Why did you land your ship on this planet?\\" the Ruler said.\\n\\n\\n \\"My job required it,\\" Korvin said.\\n\\n\\n The Ruler nodded. \\"Your job is to crash your ship,\\" he said. \\"It is\\n wasteful but the machines tell me it is true. Very well, then; we\\n shall find out more about your job. Was the crash intentional?\\"\\n\\n\\n Korvin looked sober. \\"Yes,\\" he said.\\n\\n\\n The Ruler blinked. \\"Very well,\\" he said. \\"Was your job ended when the\\n ship crashed?\\" The Tr\'en word, of course, wasn\'t\\nended\\n, nor did it\\n mean exactly that. As nearly as Korvin could make out, it meant\\n \\"disposed of for all time.\\"\\n\\n\\n \\"No,\\" he said.\\n\\n\\n \\"What else does your job entail?\\" the Ruler said.\\n\\n\\n Korvin decided to throw his first spoke into the wheel. \\"Staying\\n alive.\\"\\n\\n\\n The Ruler roared. \\"Do not waste time with the obvious!\\" he shouted.\\n \\"Do not try to trick us; we are a logical and scientific race! Answer\\n correctly.\\"\\n\\n\\n \\"I have told the truth,\\" Korvin said.\\n\\n\\n \\"But it is not\\u2014not the truth we want,\\" the Ruler said.\\n\\n\\n Korvin shrugged. \\"I replied to your question,\\" he said. \\"I did not\\n know that there was more than one kind of truth. Surely the truth is\\n the truth, just as the Ruler is the Ruler?\\"\\n\\n\\n \\"I\\u2014\\" The Ruler stopped himself in mid-roar. \\"You try to confuse the\\n Ruler,\\" he said at last, in an approximation of his usual one. \\"But\\n the Ruler will not be confused. We have experts in matters of\\n logic\\"\\u2014the Tr\'en word seemed to mean\\nright-saying\\n\\u2014\\"who will advise\\n the Ruler. They will be called.\\"\\n\\n\\n Korvin\'s guards were standing around doing nothing of importance now\\n that their captor was strapped down in the lie-detector. The Ruler\\n gestured and they went out the door in a hurry.\\n\\n\\n The Ruler looked down at Korvin. \\"You will find that you cannot trick\\n us,\\" he said. \\"You will find that such fiddling\\"\\u2014\\nchulad-like\\nKorvin\\n translated\\u2014\\"attempts will get you nowhere.\\"\\n\\n\\n Korvin devoutly hoped so.\\nThe experts in logic arrived shortly, and in no uncertain terms Korvin\\n was given to understand that logical paradox was not going to confuse\\n anybody on the planet. The barber who did, or didn\'t, shave himself,\\n the secretary of the club whose members were secretaries, Achilles and\\n the tortoise, and all the other lovely paradox-models scattered around\\n were so much primer material for the Tr\'en. \\"They can be treated\\n mathematically,\\" one of the experts, a small emerald-green being, told\\n Korvin thinly. \\"Of course, you would not understand the mathematics.\\n But that is not important. You need only understand that we cannot be\\n confused by such means.\\"\\n\\n\\n \\"Good,\\" Korvin said.\\n\\n\\n The experts blinked. \\"Good?\\" he said.\\n\\n\\n \\"Naturally,\\" Korvin said in a friendly tone.\\n\\n\\n The expert frowned horribly, showing all of his teeth. Korvin did his\\n best not to react. \\"Your plan is a failure,\\" the expert said, \\"and you\\n call this a good thing. You can mean only that your plan is different\\n from the one we are occupied with.\\"\\n\\n\\n \\"True,\\" Korvin said.\\n\\n\\n There was a short silence. The expert beamed. He examined the\\n indicators of the lie-detector with great care. \\"What is your plan?\\"\\n he said at last, in a conspiratorial whisper.\\n\\n\\n \\"To answer your questions, truthfully and logically,\\" Korvin said.\\n\\n\\n The silence this time was even longer.\\n\\n\\n \\"The machine says that you tell the truth,\\" the experts said at last,\\n in a awed tone. \\"Thus, you must be a traitor to your native planet.\\n You must want us to conquer your planet, and have come here secretly\\n to aid us.\\"\\n\\n\\n Korvin was very glad that wasn\'t a question. It was, after all, the\\n only logical deduction.\\n\\n\\n But it happened to be wrong.\\n\\"The name of your planet is Earth?\\" the Ruler asked. A few minutes had\\n passed; the experts were clustered around the single chair. Korvin was\\n still strapped to the machine; a logical race makes use of a traitor,\\n but a logical race does not trust him.\\n\\n\\n \\"Sometimes,\\" Korvin said.\\n\\n\\n \\"It has other names?\\" the Ruler said.\\n\\n\\n \\"It has no name,\\" Korvin said truthfully. The Tr\'en idiom was like the\\n Earthly one; and certainly a planet had no name. People attached names\\n to it, that was all. It had none of its own.\\n\\n\\n \\"Yet you call it Earth?\\" the Ruler said.\\n\\n\\n \\"I do,\\" Korvin said, \\"for convenience.\\"\\n\\n\\n \\"Do you know its location?\\" the Ruler said.\\n\\n\\n \\"Not with exactitude,\\" Korvin said.\\n\\n\\n There was a stir. \\"But you can find it again,\\" the Ruler said.\\n\\n\\n \\"I can,\\" Korvin said.\\n\\n\\n \\"And you will tell us about it?\\" the Ruler went on.\\n\\n\\n \\"I will,\\" Korvin said, \\"so far as I am able.\\"\\n\\n\\n \\"We will wish to know about weapons,\\" the Ruler said, \\"and about plans\\n and fortifications. But we must first know of the manner of decision\\n on this planet. Is your planet joined with others in a government or\\n does it exist alone?\\"\\n\\n\\n Korvin nearly smiled. \\"Both,\\" he said.\\n\\n\\n A short silence was broken by one of the attendant experts. \\"We have\\n theorized that an underling may be permitted to make some of his own\\n decisions, leaving only the more extensive ones for the master. This\\n seems to us inefficient and liable to error, yet it is a possible\\n system. Is it the system you mean?\\"\\n\\n\\n Very sharp, Korvin told himself grimly. \\"It is,\\" he said.\\n\\n\\n \\"Then the government which reigns over several planets is supreme,\\"\\n the Ruler said.\\n\\n\\n \\"It is,\\" Korvin said.\\n\\n\\n \\"Who is it that governs?\\" the Ruler said.\\n\\n\\n The key question had, at last, been asked. Korvin felt grateful that\\n the logical Tr\'en had determined to begin from the beginning, instead\\n of going off after details of armament first; it saved a lot of time.\\n\\n\\n \\"The answer to that question,\\" Korvin said, \\"cannot be given to you.\\"\\n\\n\\n \\"Any question of fact has an answer,\\" the Ruler snapped. \\"A paradox is\\n not involved here; a government exists, and some being is the\\n governor. Perhaps several beings share this task; perhaps machines do\\n the work. But where there is a government, there is a governor. Is\\n this agreed?\\"\\n\\n\\n \\"Certainly,\\" Korvin said. \\"It is completely obvious and true.\\"\\n\\n\\n \\"The planet from which you come is part of a system of planets which\\n are governed, you have said,\\" the Ruler went on.\\n\\n\\n \\"True,\\" Korvin said.\\n\\n\\n \\"Then there is a governor for this system,\\" the Ruler said.\\n\\n\\n \\"True,\\" Korvin said again.\\n\\n\\n The ruler sighed gently. \\"Explain this governor to us,\\" he said.\\n\\n\\n Korvin shrugged. \\"The explanation cannot be given to you.\\"\\n\\n\\n The Ruler turned to a group of his experts and a short muttered\\n conversation took place. At its end the Ruler turned his gaze back to\\n Korvin. \\"Is the deficiency in you?\\" he said. \\"Are you in some way\\n unable to describe this government?\\"\\n\\n\\n \\"It can be described,\\" Korvin said.\\n\\n\\n \\"Then you will suffer unpleasant consequences if you describe it to\\n us?\\" the Ruler went on.\\n\\n\\n \\"I will not,\\" Korvin said.\\n\\n\\n It was the signal for another conference. With some satisfaction,\\n Korvin noticed that the Tr\'en were becoming slightly puzzled; they\\n were no longer moving and speaking with calm assurance.\\n\\n\\n The plan was taking hold.\\n\\n\\n The Ruler had finished his conference. \\"You are attempting again to\\n confuse us,\\" he said.\\n\\n\\n Korvin shook his head earnestly. \\"I am attempting,\\" he said, \\"not to\\n confuse you.\\"\\n\\n\\n \\"Then I ask for an answer,\\" the Ruler said.\\n\\n\\n \\"I request that I be allowed to ask a question,\\" Korvin said.\\n\\n\\n The Ruler hesitated, then nodded. \\"Ask it,\\" he said. \\"We shall answer\\n it if we see fit to do so.\\"\\n\\n\\n Korvin tried to look grateful. \\"Well, then,\\" he said, \\"what is your\\n government?\\"\\n\\n\\n The Ruler beckoned to a heavy-set green being, who stepped forward\\n from a knot of Tr\'en, inclined his head in Korvin\'s direction, and\\n began. \\"Our government is the only logical form of government,\\" he\\n said in a high, sweet tenor. \\"The Ruler orders all, and his subjects\\n obey. In this way uniformity is gained, and this uniformity aids in\\n the speed of possible action and in the weight of action. All Tr\'en\\n act instantly in the same manner. The Ruler is adopted by the previous\\n Ruler; in this way we are assured of a common wisdom and a steady\\n judgment.\\"\\n\\n\\n \\"You have heard our government defined,\\" the Ruler said. \\"Now, you\\n will define yours for us.\\"\\n\\n\\n Korvin shook his head. \\"If you insist,\\" he said, \\"I\'ll try it. But you\\n won\'t understand it.\\"\\n\\n\\n The Ruler frowned. \\"We shall understand,\\" he said. \\"Begin. Who governs\\n you?\\"\\n\\n\\n \\"None,\\" Korvin said.\\n\\n\\n \\"But you are governed?\\"\\n\\n\\n Korvin nodded. \\"Yes.\\"\\n\\n\\n \\"Then there is a governor,\\" the Ruler insisted.\\n\\n\\n \\"True,\\" Korvin said. \\"But everyone is the governor.\\"\\n\\n\\n \\"Then there is no government,\\" the Ruler said. \\"There is no single\\n decision.\\"\\n\\n\\n \\"No,\\" Korvin said equably, \\"there are many decisions binding on all.\\"\\n\\n\\n \\"Who makes them binding?\\" the Ruler asked. \\"Who forces you to accept\\n these decisions? Some of them must be unfavorable to some beings?\\"\\n\\n\\n \\"Many of them are unfavorable,\\" Korvin said. \\"But we are not forced to\\n accept them.\\"\\n\\n\\n \\"Do you act against your own interests?\\"\\n\\n\\n Korvin shrugged. \\"Not knowingly,\\" he said. The Ruler flashed a look at\\n the technicians handling the lie-detector. Korvin turned to see their\\n expression. They needed no words; the lie-detector was telling them,\\n perfectly obviously, that he was speaking the truth. But the truth\\n wasn\'t making any sense. \\"I told you you wouldn\'t understand it,\\" he\\n said.\\n\\n\\n \\"It is a defect in your explanation,\\" the Ruler almost snarled.\\n\\n\\n \\"My explanation is as exact as it can be,\\" he said.\\n\\n\\n The Ruler breathed gustily. \\"Let us try something else,\\" he said.\\n \\"Everyone is the governor. Do you share a single mind? A racial mind\\n has been theorized, though we have met with no examples\\u2014\\"\\n\\n\\n \\"Neither have we,\\" Korvin said. \\"We are all individuals, like\\n yourselves.\\"\\n\\n\\n \\"But with no single ruler to form policy, to make decisions\\u2014\\"\\n\\n\\n \\"We have no need of one,\\" Korvin said calmly.\\n\\n\\n \\"Ah,\\" the Ruler said suddenly, as if he saw daylight ahead. \\"And why\\n not?\\"\\n\\n\\n \\"We call our form of government\\ndemocracy\\n,\\" Korvin said. \\"It means\\n the rule of the people. There is no need for another ruler.\\"\\n\\n\\n One of the experts piped up suddenly. \\"The beings themselves rule each\\n other?\\" he said. \\"This is clearly impossible; for, no one being can\\n have the force to compel acceptance of his commands. Without his\\n force, there can be no effective rule.\\"\\n\\n\\n \\"That is our form of government,\\" Korvin said.\\n\\n\\n \\"You are lying,\\" the expert said.\\n\\n\\n One of the technicians chimed in: \\"The machine tells us\\u2014\\"\\n\\n\\n \\"Then the machine is faulty,\\" the expert said. \\"It will be corrected.\\"\\n\\n\\n Korvin wondered, as the technicians argued, how long they\'d take\\n studying the machine, before they realized it didn\'t have any defects\\n to correct. He hoped it wasn\'t going to be too long; he could foresee\\n another stretch of boredom coming. And, besides, he was getting\\n homesick.\\n\\n\\n It took three days\\u2014but boredom never really had a chance to set in.\\n Korvin found himself the object of more attention than he had hoped\\n for; one by one, the experts came to his cell, each with a different\\n method of resolving the obvious contradictions in his statements.\\n\\n\\n Some of them went away fuming. Others simply went away, puzzled.\\n\\n\\n On the third day Korvin escaped.\\n\\n\\n It wasn\'t very difficult; he hadn\'t thought it would be. Even the most\\n logical of thinking beings has a subconscious as well as a conscious\\n mind, and one of the ways of dealing with an insoluble problem is to\\n make the problem disappear. There were only two ways of doing that,\\n and killing the problem\'s main focus was a little more complicated.\\n That couldn\'t be done by the subconscious mind; the conscious had to\\n intervene somewhere. And it couldn\'t.\\n\\n\\n Because that would mean recognizing, fully and consciously, that the\\n problem\\nwas\\ninsoluble. And the Tr\'en weren\'t capable of that sort of\\n thinking.\\n\\n\\n Korvin thanked his lucky stars that their genius had been restricted\\n to the physical and mathematical. Any insight at all into the mental\\n sciences would have given them the key to his existence, and his\\n entire plan, within seconds.\\n\\n\\n But, then, it was lack of that insight that had called for this\\n particular plan. That, and the political structure of the Tr\'en.\\n\\n\\n The same lack of insight let the Tr\'en subconscious work on his\\n escape without any annoying distractions in the way of deep\\n reflection. Someone left a door unlocked and a weapon nearby\\u2014all\\n quite intent, Korvin was sure. Getting to the ship was a little more\\n complicated, but presented no new problems; he was airborne, and then\\n space-borne, inside of a few hours after leaving the cell.\\n\\n\\n He set his course, relaxed, and cleared his mind. He had no psionic\\n talents, but the men at Earth Central did; he couldn\'t receive\\n messages, but he could send them. He sent one now.\\nMission accomplished; the Tr\'en aren\'t about to come\\n marauding out into space too soon. They\'ve been given food\\n for thought\\u2014nice indigestible food that\'s going to stick in\\n their craws until they finally manage to digest it. But they\\n can\'t digest it and stay what they are; you\'ve got to be\\n democratic, to some extent, to understand the idea. What\\n keeps us obeying laws we ourselves make? What keeps us\\n obeying laws that make things inconvenient for us? Sheer\\n self-interest, of course\\u2014but try to make a Tr\'en see it!\\nWith one government and one language, they just weren\'t\\n equipped for translation. They were too efficient physically\\n to try for the mental sciences at all. No mental sciences,\\n no insight into my mind or their own\\u2014and that means no\\n translation.\\nBut\\u2014damn it\\u2014I wish I were home already.\\nI\'m bored absolutely stiff!\\nTHE END\\n\\nQuestion:\\nWhy did the Tr\'en leave Korvin\'s door unlocked and a weapon nearby?\\nOptions:\\nA: They were so caught up trying to figure out  Korvin\'s answers that they became somewhat careless in guarding him. \\nB: Their subconscious knew that Korvin was an insoluble problem. This same subconscious led them to provide resources for his escape so they wouldn\'t have to deal with him anymore. \\nC: They were tired of the Ruler\'s dictatorship and intentionally provided resources for Korvin\'s escape in hopes that he would help them overthrow the Ruler.  \\nD: After their interview with Korvin, they determined he was wasteful and confusing, but not a threat. In order to avoid another confusing interaction with him, they simply provided resources for his escape. \\nAnswer:", "raw": false}], "stream": false, "max_tokens": 2, "temperature": 0.0}'

 THE GIRL IN HIS MIND
By ROBERT F. YOUNG


 [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from

 Worlds of Tomorrow April 1963

Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of
 love and lust
Question:
How much time has passed between Blake's night with Eldoria and his search for Sabrina York in his mind-world?
Options:
A: 7 years
B: 10 hours
C: 12 years
D: 1 hour

 TRANSLATION
By
LARRY M.

 HARRIS
In language translation, you may get a literally accurate
 word-for-word translation ... but miss the meaning entirely. And in
 space-type translation ... the effect may be the same!
Illustrated by Schoenherr
The cell had been put together more efficiently than any Korvin had
 ever been in. But that was only natural, he told himself sadly; the
 Tr'en were an efficient people. All the preliminary reports had agreed
 on that; their efficiency, as a matter of fact, was what had made
 Korvin's arrival a necessity. They were well into the atomic era, and
 were on the verge of developing space travel. Before long they'd be
 settling the other planets of their system, and then the nearer stars.
 Faster-than-light travel couldn't be far away, for the magnificently
 efficient physical scientists of the Tr'en—and that would mean, in
 the ordinary course of events, an invitation to join the Comity of
 Planets.


 An invitation, the Comity was sure, which the Tr'en would not accept.


 Korvin stretched out on the cell's single bunk, a rigid affair which
 was hardly meant for comfort, and sighed. He'd had three days of
 isolation, with nothing to do but explore the resources of his own
 mind. He'd tried some of the ancient Rhine experiments, but that was
 no good; he still didn't show any particular psi talents. He couldn't
 unlock the cell door with his unaided mind; he couldn't even alter the
 probability of a single dust-mote's Brownian path through the somewhat
 smelly air. Nor could he disappear from his cell and appear, as if by
 magic, several miles away near the slightly-damaged hulk of his ship,
 to the wonder and amazement of his Tr'en captors.


 He could do, as a matter of fact, precisely nothing. He wished quietly
 that the Tr'en had seen fit to give him a pack of cards, or a book, or
 even a folder of tourist pictures. The Wonders of Tr'en, according to
 all the advance reports, were likely to be pretty boring, but they'd
 have been better than nothing.


 In any decently-run jail, he told himself with indignation, there
 would at least have been other prisoners to talk to. But on Tr'en
 Korvin was all alone.


 True, every night the guards came in and gave him a concentrated
 lesson in the local language, but Korvin failed to get much pleasure
 out of that, being unconscious at the time. But now he was equipped to
 discuss almost anything from philosophy to plumbing, but there was
 nobody to discuss it with. He changed position on the bunk and stared
 at the walls. The Tr'en were efficient; there weren't even any
 imperfections in the smooth surface to distract him.


 He wasn't tired and he wasn't hungry; his captors had left him with a
 full stock of food concentrates.


 But he was almightily bored, and about ready to tell anything to
 anyone, just for the chance at a little conversation.


 As he reached this dismal conclusion, the cell door opened. Korvin got
 up off the bunk in a hurry and spun around to face his visitor.


 The Tr'en was tall, and slightly green.


 He looked, as all the Tr'en did, vaguely humanoid—that is, if you
 don't bother to examine him closely. Life in the universe appeared to
 be rigidly limited to humanoid types on oxygen planets; Korvin didn't
 know why, and neither did anybody else. There were a lot of theories,
 but none that accounted for all the facts satisfactorily. Korvin
 really didn't care about it; it was none of his business.


 The Tr'en regarded him narrowly through catlike pupils. "You are
 Korvin," he said.


 It was a ritual, Korvin had learned. "You are of the Tr'en," he
 replied. The green being nodded.


 "I am Didyak of the Tr'en," he said. Amenities over with, he relaxed
 slightly—but no more than slightly—and came into the cell, closing
 the door behind him. Korvin thought of jumping the Tr'en, but decided
 quickly against it. He was a captive, and it was unwise to assume that
 his captors had no more resources than the ones he saw: a small
 translucent pistollike affair in a holster at the Tr'en's side, and a
 small knife in a sheath at the belt. Those Korvin could deal with; but
 there might be almost anything else hidden and ready to fire on him.


 "What do you want with me?" Korvin said. The Tr'en speech—apparently
 there was only one language on the planet—was stiff and slightly
 awkward, but easily enough learned under drug hypnosis; it was the
 most rigorously logical construction of its kind Korvin had ever come
 across. It reminded him of some of the mathematical metalanguages he'd
 dealt with back on Earth, in training; but it was more closely and
 carefully constructed than even those marvels.


 "I want nothing with you," Didyak said, leaning against the
 door-frame. "You have other questions?"


 Korvin sighed. "What are you doing here, then?" he asked. As
 conversation, it wasn't very choice; but it was, he admitted, better
 than solitude.


 "I am leaning against the door," Didyak said. The Tr'en literalist
 approach to the smallest problems of everyday living was a little hard
 to get the hang of, Korvin told himself bitterly. He thought for a
 second.


 "Why did you come to me?" he said at last.


 Didyak beamed at him. The sight was remarkably unpleasant, involving
 as it did the disclosure of the Tr'en fifty-eight teeth, mostly
 pointed. Korvin stared back impassively. "I have been ordered to come
 to you," Didyak said, "by the Ruler. The Ruler wishes to talk with
 you."


 It wasn't quite "talk"; that was a general word in the Tr'en language,
 and Didyak had used a specific meaning, roughly: "gain information
 from, by peaceful and vocal means." Korvin filed it away for future
 reference. "Why did the Ruler not come to me?" Korvin asked.


 "The Ruler is the Ruler," Didyak said, slightly discomfited. "You are
 to go to him. Such is his command."


 Korvin shrugged, sighed and smoothed back his hair. "I obey the
 command of the Ruler," he said—another ritual. Everybody obeyed the
 command of the Ruler. If you didn't, you never had a second chance to
 try.


 But Korvin meant exactly what he'd said. He was going to obey the
 commands of the Ruler of the Tr'en—and remove the Tr'en threat from
 the rest of the galaxy forever.


 That, after all, was his job.
The Room of the Ruler was large, square and excessively brown. The
 walls were dark-brown, the furnishings—a single great chair, several
 kneeling-benches and a small table near the chair—were light-brown,
 of some metallic substance, and even the drapes were tan. It was,
 Korvin decided, much too much of a bad idea, even when the color
 contrast of the Tr'en themselves were figured in.


 The Ruler himself, a Tr'en over seven feet tall and correspondingly
 broad, sat in the great chair, his four fingers tapping gently on the
 table near him, staring at Korvin and his guards. The guards stood on
 either side of their captive, looking as impassive as jade statues,
 six and a half feet high.


 Korvin wasn't attempting to escape. He wasn't pleading with the Ruler.
 He wasn't defying the Ruler, either. He was just answering questions.


 The Tr'en liked to have everything clear. They were a logical race.
 The Ruler had started with Korvin's race, his name, his sex—if
 any—and whether or not his appearance were normal for humanity.


 Korvin was answering the last question. "Some men are larger than I
 am," he said, "and some are smaller."


 "Within what limits?"


 Korvin shrugged. "Some are over eight feet tall," he said, "and others
 under four feet." He used the Tr'en measurement scale, of course; it
 didn't seem necessary, though, to mention that both extremes of height
 were at the circus-freak level. "Then there is a group of humans," he
 went on, "who are never more than a foot and a half in height, and
 usually less than that—approximately nine or ten inches. We call
 these
children
," he volunteered helpfully.


 "Approximately?" the Ruler growled. "We ask for precision here," he
 said. "We are scientific men. We are exact."


 Korvin nodded hurriedly. "Our race is more ... more approximate," he
 said apologetically.


 "Slipshod," the Ruler muttered.


 "Undoubtedly," Korvin agreed politely. "I'll try to do the best I can
 for you."


 "You will answer my questions," the Ruler said, "with exactitude." He
 paused, frowning slightly. "You landed your ship on this planet," he
 went on. "Why?"


 "My job required it," Korvin said.


 "A clumsy lie," the Ruler said. "The ship crashed; our examinations
 prove that beyond any doubt."


 "True," Korvin said.


 "And it is your job to crash your ship?" the Ruler said. "Wasteful."


 Korvin shrugged again. "What I say is true," he announced. "Do you
 have tests for such matters?"


 "We do," the Ruler told him. "We are an exact and a scientific race. A
 machine for the testing of truth has been adjusted to your physiology.
 It will be attached to you."


 Korvin looked around and saw it coming through the door, pushed by two
 technicians. It was large and squat and metallic, and it had wheels,
 dials, blinking lights, tubes and wires, and a seat with armrests and
 straps. It was obviously a form of lie-detector—and Korvin felt
 himself marveling again at this race. Earth science had nothing to
 match their enormous command of the physical universe; adapting a
 hypnopædic language-course to an alien being so quickly had been
 wonder enough, but adapting the perilously delicate mechanisms that
 necessarily made up any lie-detector machinery was almost a miracle.
 The Tr'en, under other circumstances, would have been a valuable
 addition to the Comity of Nations.


 Being what they were, though, they could only be a menace. And
 Korvin's appreciation of the size of that menace was growing hourly.


 He hoped the lie-detector had been adjusted correctly. If it showed
 him telling an untruth, he wasn't likely to live long, and his
 job—not to mention the strongest personal inclinations—demanded most
 strongly that he stay alive.


 He swallowed hard. But when the technicians forced him down into the
 seat, buckled straps around him, attached wires and electrodes and
 elastic bands to him at appropriate places and tightened some final
 screws, he made no resistance.


 "We shall test the machine," the Ruler said. "In what room are you?"


 "In the Room of the Ruler," Korvin said equably.


 "Are you standing or sitting?"


 "I am sitting," Korvin said.


 "Are you a
chulad
?" the Ruler asked. A
chulad
was a small native
 pet, Korvin knew, something like a greatly magnified deathwatch
 beetle.


 "I am not," he said.
The Ruler looked to his technicians for a signal, and nodded on
 receiving it. "You will tell an untruth now," he said. "Are you
 standing or sitting?"


 "I am standing," Korvin said.


 The technicians gave another signal. The Ruler looked, in his frowning
 manner, reasonably satisfied. "The machine," he announced, "has been
 adjusted satisfactorily to your physiology. The questioning will now
 continue."


 Korvin swallowed again. The test hadn't really seemed extensive enough
 to him. But, after all, the Tr'en knew their business, better than
 anyone else could know it. They had the technique and the logic and
 the training.


 He hoped they were right.


 The Ruler was frowning at him. Korvin did his best to look receptive.
 "Why did you land your ship on this planet?" the Ruler said.


 "My job required it," Korvin said.


 The Ruler nodded. "Your job is to crash your ship," he said. "It is
 wasteful but the machines tell me it is true. Very well, then; we
 shall find out more about your job. Was the crash intentional?"


 Korvin looked sober. "Yes," he said.


 The Ruler blinked. "Very well," he said. "Was your job ended when the
 ship crashed?" The Tr'en word, of course, wasn't
ended
, nor did it
 mean exactly that. As nearly as Korvin could make out, it meant
 "disposed of for all time."


 "No," he said.


 "What else does your job entail?" the Ruler said.


 Korvin decided to throw his first spoke into the wheel. "Staying
 alive."


 The Ruler roared. "Do not waste time with the obvious!" he shouted.
 "Do not try to trick us; we are a logical and scientific race! Answer
 correctly."


 "I have told the truth," Korvin said.


 "But it is not—not the truth we want," the Ruler said.


 Korvin shrugged. "I replied to your question," he said. "I did not
 know that there was more than one kind of truth. Surely the truth is
 the truth, just as the Ruler is the Ruler?"


 "I—" The Ruler stopped himself in mid-roar. "You try to confuse the
 Ruler," he said at last, in an approximation of his usual one. "But
 the Ruler will not be confused. We have experts in matters of
 logic"—the Tr'en word seemed to mean
right-saying
—"who will advise
 the Ruler. They will be called."


 Korvin's guards were standing around doing nothing of importance now
 that their captor was strapped down in the lie-detector. The Ruler
 gestured and they went out the door in a hurry.


 The Ruler looked down at Korvin. "You will find that you cannot trick
 us," he said. "You will find that such fiddling"—
chulad-like
Korvin
 translated—"attempts will get you nowhere."


 Korvin devoutly hoped so.
The experts in logic arrived shortly, and in no uncertain terms Korvin
 was given to understand that logical paradox was not going to confuse
 anybody on the planet. The barber who did, or didn't, shave himself,
 the secretary of the club whose members were secretaries, Achilles and
 the tortoise, and all the other lovely paradox-models scattered around
 were so much primer material for the Tr'en. "They can be treated
 mathematically," one of the experts, a small emerald-green being, told
 Korvin thinly. "Of course, you would not understand the mathematics.
 But that is not important. You need only understand that we cannot be
 confused by such means."


 "Good," Korvin said.


 The experts blinked. "Good?" he said.


 "Naturally," Korvin said in a friendly tone.


 The expert frowned horribly, showing all of his teeth. Korvin did his
 best not to react. "Your plan is a failure," the expert said, "and you
 call this a good thing. You can mean only that your plan is different
 from the one we are occupied with."


 "True," Korvin said.


 There was a short silence. The expert beamed. He examined the
 indicators of the lie-detector with great care. "What is your plan?"
 he said at last, in a conspiratorial whisper.


 "To answer your questions, truthfully and logically," Korvin said.


 The silence this time was even longer.


 "The machine says that you tell the truth," the experts said at last,
 in a awed tone. "Thus, you must be a traitor to your native planet.
 You must want us to conquer your planet, and have come here secretly
 to aid us."


 Korvin was very glad that wasn't a question. It was, after all, the
 only logical deduction.


 But it happened to be wrong.
"The name of your planet is Earth?" the Ruler asked. A few minutes had
 passed; the experts were clustered around the single chair. Korvin was
 still strapped to the machine; a logical race makes use of a traitor,
 but a logical race does not trust him.


 "Sometimes," Korvin said.


 "It has other names?" the Ruler said.


 "It has no name," Korvin said truthfully. The Tr'en idiom was like the
 Earthly one; and certainly a planet had no name. People attached names
 to it, that was all. It had none of its own.


 "Yet you call it Earth?" the Ruler said.


 "I do," Korvin said, "for convenience."


 "Do you know its location?" the Ruler said.


 "Not with exactitude," Korvin said.


 There was a stir. "But you can find it again," the Ruler said.


 "I can," Korvin said.


 "And you will tell us about it?" the Ruler went on.


 "I will," Korvin said, "so far as I am able."


 "We will wish to know about weapons," the Ruler said, "and about plans
 and fortifications. But we must first know of the manner of decision
 on this planet. Is your planet joined with others in a government or
 does it exist alone?"


 Korvin nearly smiled. "Both," he said.


 A short silence was broken by one of the attendant experts. "We have
 theorized that an underling may be permitted to make some of his own
 decisions, leaving only the more extensive ones for the master. This
 seems to us inefficient and liable to error, yet it is a possible
 system. Is it the system you mean?"


 Very sharp, Korvin told himself grimly. "It is," he said.


 "Then the government which reigns over several planets is supreme,"
 the Ruler said.


 "It is," Korvin said.


 "Who is it that governs?" the Ruler said.


 The key question had, at last, been asked. Korvin felt grateful that
 the logical Tr'en had determined to begin from the beginning, instead
 of going off after details of armament first; it saved a lot of time.


 "The answer to that question," Korvin said, "cannot be given to you."


 "Any question of fact has an answer," the Ruler snapped. "A paradox is
 not involved here; a government exists, and some being is the
 governor. Perhaps several beings share this task; perhaps machines do
 the work. But where there is a government, there is a governor. Is
 this agreed?"


 "Certainly," Korvin said. "It is completely obvious and true."


 "The planet from which you come is part of a system of planets which
 are governed, you have said," the Ruler went on.


 "True," Korvin said.


 "Then there is a governor for this system," the Ruler said.


 "True," Korvin said again.


 The ruler sighed gently. "Explain this governor to us," he said.


 Korvin shrugged. "The explanation cannot be given to you."


 The Ruler turned to a group of his experts and a short muttered
 conversation took place. At its end the Ruler turned his gaze back to
 Korvin. "Is the deficiency in you?" he said. "Are you in some way
 unable to describe this government?"


 "It can be described," Korvin said.


 "Then you will suffer unpleasant consequences if you describe it to
 us?" the Ruler went on.


 "I will not," Korvin said.


 It was the signal for another conference. With some satisfaction,
 Korvin noticed that the Tr'en were becoming slightly puzzled; they
 were no longer moving and speaking with calm assurance.


 The plan was taking hold.


 The Ruler had finished his conference. "You are attempting again to
 confuse us," he said.


 Korvin shook his head earnestly. "I am attempting," he said, "not to
 confuse you."


 "Then I ask for an answer," the Ruler said.


 "I request that I be allowed to ask a question," Korvin said.


 The Ruler hesitated, then nodded. "Ask it," he said. "We shall answer
 it if we see fit to do so."


 Korvin tried to look grateful. "Well, then," he said, "what is your
 government?"


 The Ruler beckoned to a heavy-set green being, who stepped forward
 from a knot of Tr'en, inclined his head in Korvin's direction, and
 began. "Our government is the only logical form of government," he
 said in a high, sweet tenor. "The Ruler orders all, and his subjects
 obey. In this way uniformity is gained, and this uniformity aids in
 the speed of possible action and in the weight of action. All Tr'en
 act instantly in the same manner. The Ruler is adopted by the previous
 Ruler; in this way we are assured of a common wisdom and a steady
 judgment."


 "You have heard our government defined," the Ruler said. "Now, you
 will define yours for us."


 Korvin shook his head. "If you insist," he said, "I'll try it. But you
 won't understand it."


 The Ruler frowned. "We shall understand," he said. "Begin. Who governs
 you?"


 "None," Korvin said.


 "But you are governed?"


 Korvin nodded. "Yes."


 "Then there is a governor," the Ruler insisted.


 "True," Korvin said. "But everyone is the governor."


 "Then there is no government," the Ruler said. "There is no single
 decision."


 "No," Korvin said equably, "there are many decisions binding on all."


 "Who makes them binding?" the Ruler asked. "Who forces you to accept
 these decisions? Some of them must be unfavorable to some beings?"


 "Many of them are unfavorable," Korvin said. "But we are not forced to
 accept them."


 "Do you act against your own interests?"


 Korvin shrugged. "Not knowingly," he said. The Ruler flashed a look at
 the technicians handling the lie-detector. Korvin turned to see their
 expression. They needed no words; the lie-detector was telling them,
 perfectly obviously, that he was speaking the truth. But the truth
 wasn't making any sense. "I told you you wouldn't understand it," he
 said.


 "It is a defect in your explanation," the Ruler almost snarled.


 "My explanation is as exact as it can be," he said.


 The Ruler breathed gustily. "Let us try something else," he said.
 "Everyone is the governor. Do you share a single mind? A racial mind
 has been theorized, though we have met with no examples—"


 "Neither have we," Korvin said. "We are all individuals, like
 yourselves."


 "But with no single ruler to form policy, to make decisions—"


 "We have no need of one," Korvin said calmly.


 "Ah," the Ruler said suddenly, as if he saw daylight ahead. "And why
 not?"


 "We call our form of government
democracy
," Korvin said. "It means
 the rule of the people. There is no need for another ruler."


 One of the experts piped up suddenly. "The beings themselves rule each
 other?" he said. "This is clearly impossible; for, no one being can
 have the force to compel acceptance of his commands. Without his
 force, there can be no effective rule."


 "That is our form of government," Korvin said.


 "You are lying," the expert said.


 One of the technicians chimed in: "The machine tells us—"


 "Then the machine is faulty," the expert said. "It will be corrected."


 Korvin wondered, as the technicians argued, how long they'd take
 studying the machine, before they realized it didn't have any defects
 to correct. He hoped it wasn't going to be too long; he could foresee
 another stretch of boredom coming. And, besides, he was getting
 homesick.


 It took three days—but boredom never really had a chance to set in.
 Korvin found himself the object of more attention than he had hoped
 for; one by one, the experts came to his cell, each with a different
 method of resolving the obvious contradictions in his statements.


 Some of them went away fuming. Others simply went away, puzzled.


 On the third day Korvin escaped.


 It wasn't very difficult; he hadn't thought it would be. Even the most
 logical of thinking beings has a subconscious as well as a conscious
 mind, and one of the ways of dealing with an insoluble problem is to
 make the problem disappear. There were only two ways of doing that,
 and killing the problem's main focus was a little more complicated.
 That couldn't be done by the subconscious mind; the conscious had to
 intervene somewhere. And it couldn't.


 Because that would mean recognizing, fully and consciously, that the
 problem
was
insoluble. And the Tr'en weren't capable of that sort of
 thinking.


 Korvin thanked his lucky stars that their genius had been restricted
 to the physical and mathematical. Any insight at all into the mental
 sciences would have given them the key to his existence, and his
 entire plan, within seconds.


 But, then, it was lack of that insight that had called for this
 particular plan. That, and the political structure of the Tr'en.


 The same lack of insight let the Tr'en subconscious work on his
 escape without any annoying distractions in the way of deep
 reflection. Someone left a door unlocked and a weapon nearby—all
 quite intent, Korvin was sure. Getting to the ship was a little more
 complicated, but presented no new problems; he was airborne, and then
 space-borne, inside of a few hours after leaving the cell.


 He set his course, relaxed, and cleared his mind. He had no psionic
 talents, but the men at Earth Central did; he couldn't receive
 messages, but he could send them. He sent one now.
Mission accomplished; the Tr'en aren't about to come
 marauding out into space too soon. They've been given food
 for thought—nice indigestible food that's going to stick in
 their craws until they finally manage to digest it. But they
 can't digest it and stay what they are; you've got to be
 democratic, to some extent, to understand the idea. What
 keeps us obeying laws we ourselves make? What keeps us
 obeying laws that make things inconvenient for us? Sheer
 self-interest, of course—but try to make a Tr'en see it!
With one government and one language, they just weren't
 equipped for translation. They were too efficient physically
 to try for the mental sciences at all. No mental sciences,
 no insight into my mind or their own—and that means no
 translation.
But—damn it—I wish I were home already.
I'm bored absolutely stiff!
THE END

Question:
Why did the Tr'en leave Korvin's door unlocked and a weapon nearby?
Options:
A: They were so caught up trying to figure out  Korvin's answers that they became somewhat careless in guarding him. 
B: Their subconscious knew that Korvin was an insoluble problem. This same subconscious led them to provide resources for his escape so they wouldn't have to deal with him anymore. 
C: They were tired of the Ruler's dictatorship and intentionally provided resources for Korvin's escape in hopes that he would help them overthrow the Ruler.  
D: After their interview with Korvin, they determined he was wasteful and confusing, but not a threat. In order to avoid another confusing interaction with him, they simply provided resources for his escape.

Expurgated or not, however,\n it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted\n the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the\n nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was\n slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the\n shadows at the back of the room. \"Is she free?\" he asked.\n\n\n \"I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps.\"\n\n\n Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of\n love and lust\nQuestion:\nHow much time has passed between Blake's night with Eldoria and his search for Sabrina York in his mind-world?\nOptions:\nA: 7 years\nB: 10 hours\nC: 12 years\nD: 1 hour\nAnswer: B\n\n\nPassage:\n LOST\n\n IN\n\n TRANSLATION\nBy\nLARRY M.\n\n HARRIS\nIn language translation, you may get a literally accurate\n word-for-word translation ... but miss the meaning entirely. And in\n space-type translation ... the effect may be the same!\nIllustrated by Schoenherr\nThe cell had been put together more efficiently than any Korvin had\n ever been in. But that was only natural, he told himself sadly; the\n Tr'en were an efficient people. All the preliminary reports had agreed\n on that; their efficiency, as a matter of fact, was what had made\n Korvin's arrival a necessity. They were well into the atomic era, and\n were on the verge of developing space travel. Before long they'd be\n settling the other planets of their system, and then the nearer stars.\n Faster-than-light travel couldn't be far away, for the magnificently\n efficient physical scientists of the Tr'en—and that would mean, in\n the ordinary course of events, an invitation to join the Comity of\n Planets.\n\n\n An invitation, the Comity was sure, which the Tr'en would not accept.\n\n\n Korvin stretched out on the cell's single bunk, a rigid affair which\n was hardly meant for comfort, and sighed. He'd had three days of\n isolation, with nothing to do but explore the resources of his own\n mind. He'd tried some of the ancient Rhine experiments, but that was\n no good; he still didn't show any particular psi talents. He couldn't\n unlock the cell door with his unaided mind; he couldn't even alter the\n probability of a single dust-mote's Brownian path through the somewhat\n smelly air. Nor could he disappear from his cell and appear, as if by\n magic, several miles away near the slightly-damaged hulk of his ship,\n to the wonder and amazement of his Tr'en captors.\n\n\n He could do, as a matter of fact, precisely nothing. He wished quietly\n that the Tr'en had seen fit to give him a pack of cards, or a book, or\n even a folder of tourist pictures. The Wonders of Tr'en, according to\n all the advance reports, were likely to be pretty boring, but they'd\n have been better than nothing.\n\n\n In any decently-run jail, he told himself with indignation, there\n would at least have been other prisoners to talk to. But on Tr'en\n Korvin was all alone.\n\n\n True, every night the guards came in and gave him a concentrated\n lesson in the local language, but Korvin failed to get much pleasure\n out of that, being unconscious at the time. But now he was equipped to\n discuss almost anything from philosophy to plumbing, but there was\n nobody to discuss it with. He changed position on the bunk and stared\n at the walls. The Tr'en were efficient; there weren't even any\n imperfections in the smooth surface to distract him.\n\n\n He wasn't tired and he wasn't hungry; his captors had left him with a\n full stock of food concentrates.\n\n\n But he was almightily bored, and about ready to tell anything to\n anyone, just for the chance at a little conversation.\n\n\n As he reached this dismal conclusion, the cell door opened. Korvin got\n up off the bunk in a hurry and spun around to face his visitor.\n\n\n The Tr'en was tall, and slightly green.\n\n\n He looked, as all the Tr'en did, vaguely humanoid—that is, if you\n don't bother to examine him closely. Life in the universe appeared to\n be rigidly limited to humanoid types on oxygen planets; Korvin didn't\n know why, and neither did anybody else. There were a lot of theories,\n but none that accounted for all the facts satisfactorily. Korvin\n really didn't care about it; it was none of his business.\n\n\n The Tr'en regarded him narrowly through catlike pupils. \"You are\n Korvin,\" he said.\n\n\n It was a ritual, Korvin had learned. \"You are of the Tr'en,\" he\n replied. The green being nodded.\n\n\n \"I am Didyak of the Tr'en,\" he said. Amenities over with, he relaxed\n slightly—but no more than slightly—and came into the cell, closing\n the door behind him. Korvin thought of jumping the Tr'en, but decided\n quickly against it. He was a captive, and it was unwise to assume that\n his captors had no more resources than the ones he saw: a small\n translucent pistollike affair in a holster at the Tr'en's side, and a\n small knife in a sheath at the belt. Those Korvin could deal with; but\n there might be almost anything else hidden and ready to fire on him.\n\n\n \"What do you want with me?\" Korvin said. The Tr'en speech—apparently\n there was only one language on the planet—was stiff and slightly\n awkward, but easily enough learned under drug hypnosis; it was the\n most rigorously logical construction of its kind Korvin had ever come\n across. It reminded him of some of the mathematical metalanguages he'd\n dealt with back on Earth, in training; but it was more closely and\n carefully constructed than even those marvels.\n\n\n \"I want nothing with you,\" Didyak said, leaning against the\n door-frame. \"You have other questions?\"\n\n\n Korvin sighed. \"What are you doing here, then?\" he asked. As\n conversation, it wasn't very choice; but it was, he admitted, better\n than solitude.\n\n\n \"I am leaning against the door,\" Didyak said. The Tr'en literalist\n approach to the smallest problems of everyday living was a little hard\n to get the hang of, Korvin told himself bitterly. He thought for a\n second.\n\n\n \"Why did you come to me?\" he said at last.\n\n\n Didyak beamed at him. The sight was remarkably unpleasant, involving\n as it did the disclosure of the Tr'en fifty-eight teeth, mostly\n pointed. Korvin stared back impassively. \"I have been ordered to come\n to you,\" Didyak said, \"by the Ruler. The Ruler wishes to talk with\n you.\"\n\n\n It wasn't quite \"talk\"; that was a general word in the Tr'en language,\n and Didyak had used a specific meaning, roughly: \"gain information\n from, by peaceful and vocal means.\" Korvin filed it away for future\n reference. \"Why did the Ruler not come to me?\" Korvin asked.\n\n\n \"The Ruler is the Ruler,\" Didyak said, slightly discomfited. \"You are\n to go to him. Such is his command.\"\n\n\n Korvin shrugged, sighed and smoothed back his hair. \"I obey the\n command of the Ruler,\" he said—another ritual. Everybody obeyed the\n command of the Ruler. If you didn't, you never had a second chance to\n try.\n\n\n But Korvin meant exactly what he'd said. He was going to obey the\n commands of the Ruler of the Tr'en—and remove the Tr'en threat from\n the rest of the galaxy forever.\n\n\n That, after all, was his job.\nThe Room of the Ruler was large, square and excessively brown. The\n walls were dark-brown, the furnishings—a single great chair, several\n kneeling-benches and a small table near the chair—were light-brown,\n of some metallic substance, and even the drapes were tan. It was,\n Korvin decided, much too much of a bad idea, even when the color\n contrast of the Tr'en themselves were figured in.\n\n\n The Ruler himself, a Tr'en over seven feet tall and correspondingly\n broad, sat in the great chair, his four fingers tapping gently on the\n table near him, staring at Korvin and his guards. The guards stood on\n either side of their captive, looking as impassive as jade statues,\n six and a half feet high.\n\n\n Korvin wasn't attempting to escape. He wasn't pleading with the Ruler.\n He wasn't defying the Ruler, either. He was just answering questions.\n\n\n The Tr'en liked to have everything clear. They were a logical race.\n The Ruler had started with Korvin's race, his name, his sex—if\n any—and whether or not his appearance were normal for humanity.\n\n\n Korvin was answering the last question. \"Some men are larger than I\n am,\" he said, \"and some are smaller.\"\n\n\n \"Within what limits?\"\n\n\n Korvin shrugged. \"Some are over eight feet tall,\" he said, \"and others\n under four feet.\" He used the Tr'en measurement scale, of course; it\n didn't seem necessary, though, to mention that both extremes of height\n were at the circus-freak level. \"Then there is a group of humans,\" he\n went on, \"who are never more than a foot and a half in height, and\n usually less than that—approximately nine or ten inches. We call\n these\nchildren\n,\" he volunteered helpfully.\n\n\n \"Approximately?\" the Ruler growled. \"We ask for precision here,\" he\n said. \"We are scientific men. We are exact.\"\n\n\n Korvin nodded hurriedly. \"Our race is more ... more approximate,\" he\n said apologetically.\n\n\n \"Slipshod,\" the Ruler muttered.\n\n\n \"Undoubtedly,\" Korvin agreed politely. \"I'll try to do the best I can\n for you.\"\n\n\n \"You will answer my questions,\" the Ruler said, \"with exactitude.\" He\n paused, frowning slightly. \"You landed your ship on this planet,\" he\n went on. \"Why?\"\n\n\n \"My job required it,\" Korvin said.\n\n\n \"A clumsy lie,\" the Ruler said. \"The ship crashed; our examinations\n prove that beyond any doubt.\"\n\n\n \"True,\" Korvin said.\n\n\n \"And it is your job to crash your ship?\" the Ruler said. \"Wasteful.\"\n\n\n Korvin shrugged again. \"What I say is true,\" he announced. \"Do you\n have tests for such matters?\"\n\n\n \"We do,\" the Ruler told him. \"We are an exact and a scientific race. A\n machine for the testing of truth has been adjusted to your physiology.\n It will be attached to you.\"\n\n\n Korvin looked around and saw it coming through the door, pushed by two\n technicians. It was large and squat and metallic, and it had wheels,\n dials, blinking lights, tubes and wires, and a seat with armrests and\n straps. It was obviously a form of lie-detector—and Korvin felt\n himself marveling again at this race. Earth science had nothing to\n match their enormous command of the physical universe; adapting a\n hypnopædic language-course to an alien being so quickly had been\n wonder enough, but adapting the perilously delicate mechanisms that\n necessarily made up any lie-detector machinery was almost a miracle.\n The Tr'en, under other circumstances, would have been a valuable\n addition to the Comity of Nations.\n\n\n Being what they were, though, they could only be a menace. And\n Korvin's appreciation of the size of that menace was growing hourly.\n\n\n He hoped the lie-detector had been adjusted correctly. If it showed\n him telling an untruth, he wasn't likely to live long, and his\n job—not to mention the strongest personal inclinations—demanded most\n strongly that he stay alive.\n\n\n He swallowed hard. But when the technicians forced him down into the\n seat, buckled straps around him, attached wires and electrodes and\n elastic bands to him at appropriate places and tightened some final\n screws, he made no resistance.\n\n\n \"We shall test the machine,\" the Ruler said. \"In what room are you?\"\n\n\n \"In the Room of the Ruler,\" Korvin said equably.\n\n\n \"Are you standing or sitting?\"\n\n\n \"I am sitting,\" Korvin said.\n\n\n \"Are you a\nchulad\n?\" the Ruler asked. A\nchulad\nwas a small native\n pet, Korvin knew, something like a greatly magnified deathwatch\n beetle.\n\n\n \"I am not,\" he said.\nThe Ruler looked to his technicians for a signal, and nodded on\n receiving it. \"You will tell an untruth now,\" he said. \"Are you\n standing or sitting?\"\n\n\n \"I am standing,\" Korvin said.\n\n\n The technicians gave another signal. The Ruler looked, in his frowning\n manner, reasonably satisfied. \"The machine,\" he announced, \"has been\n adjusted satisfactorily to your physiology. The questioning will now\n continue.\"\n\n\n Korvin swallowed again. The test hadn't really seemed extensive enough\n to him. But, after all, the Tr'en knew their business, better than\n anyone else could know it. They had the technique and the logic and\n the training.\n\n\n He hoped they were right.\n\n\n The Ruler was frowning at him. Korvin did his best to look receptive.\n \"Why did you land your ship on this planet?\" the Ruler said.\n\n\n \"My job required it,\" Korvin said.\n\n\n The Ruler nodded. \"Your job is to crash your ship,\" he said. \"It is\n wasteful but the machines tell me it is true. Very well, then; we\n shall find out more about your job. Was the crash intentional?\"\n\n\n Korvin looked sober. \"Yes,\" he said.\n\n\n The Ruler blinked. \"Very well,\" he said. \"Was your job ended when the\n ship crashed?\" The Tr'en word, of course, wasn't\nended\n, nor did it\n mean exactly that. As nearly as Korvin could make out, it meant\n \"disposed of for all time.\"\n\n\n \"No,\" he said.\n\n\n \"What else does your job entail?\" the Ruler said.\n\n\n Korvin decided to throw his first spoke into the wheel. \"Staying\n alive.\"\n\n\n The Ruler roared. \"Do not waste time with the obvious!\" he shouted.\n \"Do not try to trick us; we are a logical and scientific race! Answer\n correctly.\"\n\n\n \"I have told the truth,\" Korvin said.\n\n\n \"But it is not—not the truth we want,\" the Ruler said.\n\n\n Korvin shrugged. \"I replied to your question,\" he said. \"I did not\n know that there was more than one kind of truth. Surely the truth is\n the truth, just as the Ruler is the Ruler?\"\n\n\n \"I—\" The Ruler stopped himself in mid-roar. \"You try to confuse the\n Ruler,\" he said at last, in an approximation of his usual one. \"But\n the Ruler will not be confused. We have experts in matters of\n logic\"—the Tr'en word seemed to mean\nright-saying\n—\"who will advise\n the Ruler. They will be called.\"\n\n\n Korvin's guards were standing around doing nothing of importance now\n that their captor was strapped down in the lie-detector. The Ruler\n gestured and they went out the door in a hurry.\n\n\n The Ruler looked down at Korvin. \"You will find that you cannot trick\n us,\" he said. \"You will find that such fiddling\"—\nchulad-like\nKorvin\n translated—\"attempts will get you nowhere.\"\n\n\n Korvin devoutly hoped so.\nThe experts in logic arrived shortly, and in no uncertain terms Korvin\n was given to understand that logical paradox was not going to confuse\n anybody on the planet. The barber who did, or didn't, shave himself,\n the secretary of the club whose members were secretaries, Achilles and\n the tortoise, and all the other lovely paradox-models scattered around\n were so much primer material for the Tr'en. \"They can be treated\n mathematically,\" one of the experts, a small emerald-green being, told\n Korvin thinly. \"Of course, you would not understand the mathematics.\n But that is not important. You need only understand that we cannot be\n confused by such means.\"\n\n\n \"Good,\" Korvin said.\n\n\n The experts blinked. \"Good?\" he said.\n\n\n \"Naturally,\" Korvin said in a friendly tone.\n\n\n The expert frowned horribly, showing all of his teeth. Korvin did his\n best not to react. \"Your plan is a failure,\" the expert said, \"and you\n call this a good thing. You can mean only that your plan is different\n from the one we are occupied with.\"\n\n\n \"True,\" Korvin said.\n\n\n There was a short silence. The expert beamed. He examined the\n indicators of the lie-detector with great care. \"What is your plan?\"\n he said at last, in a conspiratorial whisper.\n\n\n \"To answer your questions, truthfully and logically,\" Korvin said.\n\n\n The silence this time was even longer.\n\n\n \"The machine says that you tell the truth,\" the experts said at last,\n in a awed tone. \"Thus, you must be a traitor to your native planet.\n You must want us to conquer your planet, and have come here secretly\n to aid us.\"\n\n\n Korvin was very glad that wasn't a question. It was, after all, the\n only logical deduction.\n\n\n But it happened to be wrong.\n\"The name of your planet is Earth?\" the Ruler asked. A few minutes had\n passed; the experts were clustered around the single chair. Korvin was\n still strapped to the machine; a logical race makes use of a traitor,\n but a logical race does not trust him.\n\n\n \"Sometimes,\" Korvin said.\n\n\n \"It has other names?\" the Ruler said.\n\n\n \"It has no name,\" Korvin said truthfully. The Tr'en idiom was like the\n Earthly one; and certainly a planet had no name. People attached names\n to it, that was all. It had none of its own.\n\n\n \"Yet you call it Earth?\" the Ruler said.\n\n\n \"I do,\" Korvin said, \"for convenience.\"\n\n\n \"Do you know its location?\" the Ruler said.\n\n\n \"Not with exactitude,\" Korvin said.\n\n\n There was a stir. \"But you can find it again,\" the Ruler said.\n\n\n \"I can,\" Korvin said.\n\n\n \"And you will tell us about it?\" the Ruler went on.\n\n\n \"I will,\" Korvin said, \"so far as I am able.\"\n\n\n \"We will wish to know about weapons,\" the Ruler said, \"and about plans\n and fortifications. But we must first know of the manner of decision\n on this planet. Is your planet joined with others in a government or\n does it exist alone?\"\n\n\n Korvin nearly smiled. \"Both,\" he said.\n\n\n A short silence was broken by one of the attendant experts. \"We have\n theorized that an underling may be permitted to make some of his own\n decisions, leaving only the more extensive ones for the master. This\n seems to us inefficient and liable to error, yet it is a possible\n system. Is it the system you mean?\"\n\n\n Very sharp, Korvin told himself grimly. \"It is,\" he said.\n\n\n \"Then the government which reigns over several planets is supreme,\"\n the Ruler said.\n\n\n \"It is,\" Korvin said.\n\n\n \"Who is it that governs?\" the Ruler said.\n\n\n The key question had, at last, been asked. Korvin felt grateful that\n the logical Tr'en had determined to begin from the beginning, instead\n of going off after details of armament first; it saved a lot of time.\n\n\n \"The answer to that question,\" Korvin said, \"cannot be given to you.\"\n\n\n \"Any question of fact has an answer,\" the Ruler snapped. \"A paradox is\n not involved here; a government exists, and some being is the\n governor. Perhaps several beings share this task; perhaps machines do\n the work. But where there is a government, there is a governor. Is\n this agreed?\"\n\n\n \"Certainly,\" Korvin said. \"It is completely obvious and true.\"\n\n\n \"The planet from which you come is part of a system of planets which\n are governed, you have said,\" the Ruler went on.\n\n\n \"True,\" Korvin said.\n\n\n \"Then there is a governor for this system,\" the Ruler said.\n\n\n \"True,\" Korvin said again.\n\n\n The ruler sighed gently. \"Explain this governor to us,\" he said.\n\n\n Korvin shrugged. \"The explanation cannot be given to you.\"\n\n\n The Ruler turned to a group of his experts and a short muttered\n conversation took place. At its end the Ruler turned his gaze back to\n Korvin. \"Is the deficiency in you?\" he said. \"Are you in some way\n unable to describe this government?\"\n\n\n \"It can be described,\" Korvin said.\n\n\n \"Then you will suffer unpleasant consequences if you describe it to\n us?\" the Ruler went on.\n\n\n \"I will not,\" Korvin said.\n\n\n It was the signal for another conference. With some satisfaction,\n Korvin noticed that the Tr'en were becoming slightly puzzled; they\n were no longer moving and speaking with calm assurance.\n\n\n The plan was taking hold.\n\n\n The Ruler had finished his conference. \"You are attempting again to\n confuse us,\" he said.\n\n\n Korvin shook his head earnestly. \"I am attempting,\" he said, \"not to\n confuse you.\"\n\n\n \"Then I ask for an answer,\" the Ruler said.\n\n\n \"I request that I be allowed to ask a question,\" Korvin said.\n\n\n The Ruler hesitated, then nodded. \"Ask it,\" he said. \"We shall answer\n it if we see fit to do so.\"\n\n\n Korvin tried to look grateful. \"Well, then,\" he said, \"what is your\n government?\"\n\n\n The Ruler beckoned to a heavy-set green being, who stepped forward\n from a knot of Tr'en, inclined his head in Korvin's direction, and\n began. \"Our government is the only logical form of government,\" he\n said in a high, sweet tenor. \"The Ruler orders all, and his subjects\n obey. In this way uniformity is gained, and this uniformity aids in\n the speed of possible action and in the weight of action. All Tr'en\n act instantly in the same manner. The Ruler is adopted by the previous\n Ruler; in this way we are assured of a common wisdom and a steady\n judgment.\"\n\n\n \"You have heard our government defined,\" the Ruler said. \"Now, you\n will define yours for us.\"\n\n\n Korvin shook his head. \"If you insist,\" he said, \"I'll try it. But you\n won't understand it.\"\n\n\n The Ruler frowned. \"We shall understand,\" he said. \"Begin. Who governs\n you?\"\n\n\n \"None,\" Korvin said.\n\n\n \"But you are governed?\"\n\n\n Korvin nodded. \"Yes.\"\n\n\n \"Then there is a governor,\" the Ruler insisted.\n\n\n \"True,\" Korvin said. \"But everyone is the governor.\"\n\n\n \"Then there is no government,\" the Ruler said. \"There is no single\n decision.\"\n\n\n \"No,\" Korvin said equably, \"there are many decisions binding on all.\"\n\n\n \"Who makes them binding?\" the Ruler asked. \"Who forces you to accept\n these decisions? Some of them must be unfavorable to some beings?\"\n\n\n \"Many of them are unfavorable,\" Korvin said. \"But we are not forced to\n accept them.\"\n\n\n \"Do you act against your own interests?\"\n\n\n Korvin shrugged. \"Not knowingly,\" he said. The Ruler flashed a look at\n the technicians handling the lie-detector. Korvin turned to see their\n expression. They needed no words; the lie-detector was telling them,\n perfectly obviously, that he was speaking the truth. But the truth\n wasn't making any sense. \"I told you you wouldn't understand it,\" he\n said.\n\n\n \"It is a defect in your explanation,\" the Ruler almost snarled.\n\n\n \"My explanation is as exact as it can be,\" he said.\n\n\n The Ruler breathed gustily. \"Let us try something else,\" he said.\n \"Everyone is the governor. Do you share a single mind? A racial mind\n has been theorized, though we have met with no examples—\"\n\n\n \"Neither have we,\" Korvin said. \"We are all individuals, like\n yourselves.\"\n\n\n \"But with no single ruler to form policy, to make decisions—\"\n\n\n \"We have no need of one,\" Korvin said calmly.\n\n\n \"Ah,\" the Ruler said suddenly, as if he saw daylight ahead. \"And why\n not?\"\n\n\n \"We call our form of government\ndemocracy\n,\" Korvin said. \"It means\n the rule of the people. There is no need for another ruler.\"\n\n\n One of the experts piped up suddenly. \"The beings themselves rule each\n other?\" he said. \"This is clearly impossible; for, no one being can\n have the force to compel acceptance of his commands. Without his\n force, there can be no effective rule.\"\n\n\n \"That is our form of government,\" Korvin said.\n\n\n \"You are lying,\" the expert said.\n\n\n One of the technicians chimed in: \"The machine tells us—\"\n\n\n \"Then the machine is faulty,\" the expert said. \"It will be corrected.\"\n\n\n Korvin wondered, as the technicians argued, how long they'd take\n studying the machine, before they realized it didn't have any defects\n to correct. He hoped it wasn't going to be too long; he could foresee\n another stretch of boredom coming. And, besides, he was getting\n homesick.\n\n\n It took three days—but boredom never really had a chance to set in.\n Korvin found himself the object of more attention than he had hoped\n for; one by one, the experts came to his cell, each with a different\n method of resolving the obvious contradictions in his statements.\n\n\n Some of them went away fuming. Others simply went away, puzzled.\n\n\n On the third day Korvin escaped.\n\n\n It wasn't very difficult; he hadn't thought it would be. Even the most\n logical of thinking beings has a subconscious as well as a conscious\n mind, and one of the ways of dealing with an insoluble problem is to\n make the problem disappear. There were only two ways of doing that,\n and killing the problem's main focus was a little more complicated.\n That couldn't be done by the subconscious mind; the conscious had to\n intervene somewhere. And it couldn't.\n\n\n Because that would mean recognizing, fully and consciously, that the\n problem\nwas\ninsoluble. And the Tr'en weren't capable of that sort of\n thinking.\n\n\n Korvin thanked his lucky stars that their genius had been restricted\n to the physical and mathematical. Any insight at all into the mental\n sciences would have given them the key to his existence, and his\n entire plan, within seconds.\n\n\n But, then, it was lack of that insight that had called for this\n particular plan. That, and the political structure of the Tr'en.\n\n\n The same lack of insight let the Tr'en subconscious work on his\n escape without any annoying distractions in the way of deep\n reflection. Someone left a door unlocked and a weapon nearby—all\n quite intent, Korvin was sure. Getting to the ship was a little more\n complicated, but presented no new problems; he was airborne, and then\n space-borne, inside of a few hours after leaving the cell.\n\n\n He set his course, relaxed, and cleared his mind. He had no psionic\n talents, but the men at Earth Central did; he couldn't receive\n messages, but he could send them. He sent one now.\nMission accomplished; the Tr'en aren't about to come\n marauding out into space too soon. They've been given food\n for thought—nice indigestible food that's going to stick in\n their craws until they finally manage to digest it. But they\n can't digest it and stay what they are; you've got to be\n democratic, to some extent, to understand the idea. What\n keeps us obeying laws we ourselves make? What keeps us\n obeying laws that make things inconvenient for us? Sheer\n self-interest, of course—but try to make a Tr'en see it!\nWith one government and one language, they just weren't\n equipped for translation. They were too efficient physically\n to try for the mental sciences at all. No mental sciences,\n no insight into my mind or their own—and that means no\n translation.\nBut—damn it—I wish I were home already.\nI'm bored absolutely stiff!\nTHE END\n\nQuestion:\nWhy did the Tr'en leave Korvin's door unlocked and a weapon nearby?\nOptions:\nA: They were so caught up trying to figure out  Korvin's answers that they became somewhat careless in guarding him. \nB: Their subconscious knew that Korvin was an insoluble problem. This same subconscious led them to provide resources for his escape so they wouldn't have to deal with him anymore. \nC: They were tired of the Ruler's dictatorship and intentionally provided resources for Korvin's escape in hopes that he would help them overthrow the Ruler.  \nD: After their interview with Korvin, they determined he was wasteful and confusing, but not a threat. In order to avoid another confusing interaction with him, they simply provided resources for his escape. \nAnswer:", "role": "user", "name": null, "raw": false}], "model": "rwkv", "stream": false, "stop": ["\n\nUser", "\n\nQuestion", "\n\nQ", "\n\nHuman", "\n\nBob", "\n\nAssistant", "\n\nAnswer", "\n\nA", "\n\nBot", "\n\nAlice", "\n\nObservation", "\n\nUser", "\n\nAss"], "tools": null, "tool_choice": "auto", "user_name": null, "assistant_name": null, "system_name": null, "presystem": false}
