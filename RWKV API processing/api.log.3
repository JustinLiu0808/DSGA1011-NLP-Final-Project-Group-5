Passage:
The Gravity Business
By JAMES E. GUNN


 Illustrated by ASHMAN


 [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Galaxy January 1956.
 Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright
 on this publication was renewed.]
This little alien beggar could dictate his own terms, but how could
 he—and how could anyone find out what those terms might be?
The flivver descended vertically toward the green planet circling the
 old, orange sun.


 It was a spaceship, but not the kind men had once dreamed about. The
 flivver was shaped like a crude bullet, blunt at one end of a fat
 cylinder and tapering abruptly to a point at the other. It had been
 slapped together out of sheet metal and insulation board, and it sold,
 fully equipped, for $15,730. It didn't behave like a spaceship, either.


 As it hurtled down, its speed increased with dramatic swiftness. Then,
 at the last instant before impact, it stopped. Just like that.


 A moment later, it thumped a last few inches into the ankle-deep grass
 and knee-high white flowers of the meadow. It was a shock of a jar that
 made the sheet-metal walls boom like thunder machines. The flivver
 rocked unsteadily on its flat stern before it decided to stay upright.


 Then all was quiet—outside.


 Inside the big, central cabin, Grampa waved his pircuit irately in the
 air. "Now look what you made me do! Just when I had the blamed thing
 practically whipped, too!"
Grampa was a white-haired 90-year-old who could still go 

Question:
What is Grampa’s claim to fame?

Options:
A: Striking radioactive deposits on far flung planets that can be sold back on Earth for a fortune
B: Solving all the pircuits he’d ever been challenged with
C: Being the first space missionary
D: Creating a special piece of machinery for spaceships

THE GIRL IN HIS MIND
By ROBERT F. YOUNG


 [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from

 Worlds of Tomorrow April 1963

 Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that

 the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]
Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of
 love and lust

Question:
How much time has passed between Blake's night with Eldoria and his search for Sabrina York in his mind-world?

Options:
A: 7 years
B: 10 hours
C: 12 years

Question:
Why does Deirdre get so upset when Blake Past suggests she go to prom with the young man?

Options:
A: Because Blake is trying to guilt Deirdre into going with the young man by telling her that it'll ease her conscience. 
B: Because Deirdre has fallen in love with Blake, despite his age, and wants him to take her to the prom.  
C: Because Blake is acting like he's her father, which is a sensitive topic for Deirdre because she lost her real parents. 
D: Because the young man gave up his right arm in order to afford tickets to the prom, and this disgusts Deirdre.

The flivver descended vertically toward the green planet circling the
 old, orange sun.


 It was a spaceship, but not the kind men had once dreamed about. The
 flivver was shaped like a crude bullet, blunt at one end of a fat

 slapped together out of sheet metal and insulation board, and it sold,
 fully equipped, for $15,730. It didn't behave like a spaceship, either.


 As it hurtled down, its speed increased with dramatic swiftness. Then,
 at the last instant before impact, it stopped. Just like that.


 A moment later, it thumped a last few inches into the ankle-deep grass

Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of
 love and lust

Question:
Why does shame flame in Blake's cheeks when Deirdre goes to prepare Eldoria's dias?

B: He feels that prostitution is morally reprehensible. 
C: He feels guilty about sleeping with Eldoria when there's a child in the hut, Deirdre, who knows exactly what's going on. 
D: He feels guilty about wishing Deirdre was older so he could sleep with her instead.

This little alien beggar could dictate his own terms, but how could
 he—and how could anyone find out what those terms might be?
The flivver descended vertically toward the green planet circling the
 old, orange sun.


 It was a spaceship, but not the kind men had once dreamed about. The
 flivver was shaped like a crude bullet, blunt at one end of a fat
 cylinder and tapering abruptly to a point at the other. It had been
 slapped together out of sheet metal and insulation board, and it sold,
 fully equipped, for $15,730. It didn't behave like a spaceship, either.


 As it hurtled down, its speed increased with dramatic swiftness. Then,
 at the last instant before impact, it stopped. Just like that.


 A moment later, it thumped a last few inches into the ankle-deep grass
 and knee-high white flowers of the meadow. It was a shock of a jar that
 made the sheet-metal walls boom like thunder machines. The flivver
 rocked unsteadily on its flat stern before it decided to stay upright.


 Then all was quiet—outside.


 Inside the big, central cabin, Grampa waved his pircuit irately in the
 air. "Now look what you made me do! Just when I had the blamed thing
 practically whipped, too!"
Grampa was a white-haired 90-year-old who could still go 

Question:
What is the relationship like between Four and Grampa?

Options:
A: Grampa sees Four as the least reliable of the family
B: Four is mature for his age and Grampa enjoys his companionship
C: Four challenges Grampa in a way that annoys him
D: Grampa never could understand why Four didn’t get the intelligence of the other Peppergrass progeny

The flivver descended vertically toward the green planet circling the
 old, orange sun.


 It was a spaceship, but not the kind men had once dreamed about. The
 flivver was shaped like a crude bullet, blunt at one end of a fat

THE GIRL IN HIS MIND
By ROBERT F. YOUNG

 Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that

 the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]
Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of

The flivver descended vertically toward the green planet circling the
 old, orange sun.


 It was a spaceship, but not the kind men had once dreamed about. The
 flivver was shaped like a crude bullet, blunt at one end of a fat
 cylinder and tapering abruptly to a point at the other. It had been
 slapped together out of sheet metal and insulation board, and it sold,

 As it hurtled down, its speed increased with dramatic swiftness. Then,
 at the last instant before impact, it stopped. Just like that.

 rocked unsteadily on its flat stern before it decided to stay upright.


 Then all was quiet—outside.

Passage:
THE GIRL IN HIS MIND
By ROBERT F. YOUNG


 [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from

 Worlds of Tomorrow April 1963

 Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that

 the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]
Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of
 love and lust

Question:
How much time has passed between Blake's night with Eldoria and his search for Sabrina York in his mind-world?

Options:
A: 7 years
B: 10 hours
C: 12 years
D: 1 hour

Question:
Why does Deirdre get so upset when Blake Past suggests she go to prom with the young man?

Options:
A: Because Blake is trying to guilt Deirdre into going with the young man by telling her that it'll ease her conscience. 
B: Because Deirdre has fallen in love with Blake, despite his age, and wants him to take her to the prom.  
C: Because Blake is acting like he's her father, which is a sensitive topic for Deirdre because she lost her real parents. 
D: Because the young man gave up his right arm in order to afford tickets to the prom, and this disgusts Deirdre.

THE GIRL IN HIS MIND
By ROBERT F. YOUNG


 [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from

 Worlds of Tomorrow April 1963

 Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that

 the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]
Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of
 love and lust

Question:
How much time has passed between Blake's night with Eldoria and his search for Sabrina York in his mind-world?

Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7

 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of

Passage:
THE GIRL IN HIS MIND
By ROBERT F. YOUNG


 [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from

 Worlds of Tomorrow April 1963

 Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that

 the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]
Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of
 love and lust

Question:
How much time has passed between Blake's night with Eldoria and his search for Sabrina York in his mind-world?

Options:
A: 7 years
B: 10 hours
C: 12 years

C: Because Blake is acting like he's her father, which is a sensitive topic for Deirdre because she lost her real parents.

Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated

 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the

 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."

Passage:
THE GIRL IN HIS MIND
By ROBERT F. YOUNG


 [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from

 Worlds of Tomorrow April 1963

 Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that

 the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]
Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of
 love and lust

Question:
How much time has passed between Blake's night with Eldoria and his search for Sabrina York in his mind-world?

Options:
A: 7 years
B: 10 hours
C: 12 years
D: 1 hour

C: Because Blake is acting like he's her father, which is a sensitive topic for Deirdre because she lost her real parents.

 Coleman came in the morning before I was really ready to face the

 superintendent of Dreamland. I chewed up my pill to calm me down,
 the one to pep me up, the capsule to strengthen my qualities as a

 juice and sat back, building up my fortitude to do business over the

 But instead of the usual morning run of hysterical relatives and

Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7

 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."

THE GIRL IN HIS MIND
By ROBERT F. YOUNG


 [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from

 Worlds of Tomorrow April 1963

 Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that

 the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]
Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of
 love and lust

Question:
How much time has passed between Blake's night with Eldoria and his search for Sabrina York in his mind-world?

Options:
A: 7 years
B: 10 hours
C: 12 years

 Coleman came in the morning before I was really ready to face the

 juice and sat back, building up my fortitude to do business over the

 But instead of the usual morning run of hysterical relatives and

Passage:
THE GIRL IN HIS MIND
By ROBERT F. YOUNG


 [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from

Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of
 love and lust

Question:
How much time has passed between Blake's night with Eldoria and his search for Sabrina York in his mind-world?

Options:
A: 7 years
B: 10 hours
C: 12 years
D: 1 hour

Question:
Why does Deirdre get so upset when Blake Past suggests she go to prom with the young man?

Options:
A: Because Blake is trying to guilt Deirdre into going with the young man by telling her that it'll ease her conscience. 
B: Because Deirdre has fallen in love with Blake, despite his age, and wants him to take her to the prom.  
C: Because Blake is acting like he's her father, which is a sensitive topic for Deirdre because she lost her real parents. 
D: Because the young man gave up his right arm in order to afford tickets to the prom, and this disgusts Deirdre.

Changing the world is simple; the trick is
 
to do it before you have a chance to undo it!
It was a good job and Max Alben knew whom he had to thank for it—his
 great-grandfather.


 "Good old Giovanni Albeni," he muttered as he hurried into the
 laboratory slightly ahead of the escorting technicians, all of them,
 despite the excitement of the moment, remembering to bob their heads
 deferentially at the half-dozen full-fleshed and hard-faced men
 lolling on the couches that had been set up around the time machine.


 He shrugged rapidly out of his rags, as he had been instructed in the
 anteroom, and stepped into the housing of the enormous mechanism.
 This was the first time he had seen it, since he had been taught
 how to operate it on a dummy model, and now he stared at the great
 transparent coils and the susurrating energy bubble with much respect.


 This machine, the pride and the hope of 2089, was something almost
 outside his powers of comprehension. But Max Alben knew how to run it,
 and he knew, roughly, what it was supposed to accomplish. He knew also
 that this was the first backward journey of any great duration and,
 being scientifically unpredictable, might well be the death of him.

Question:
What were Alben’s intentions before he time travelled?

Options:
A: He anticipated being able to improve his status in life
B: He anticipated an adventure and felt privileged to go on one
C: He intended to double cross those who gave him orders
D: He anticipated changing the way the world was governed

Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."

Changing the world is simple; the trick is
 
to do it before you have a chance to undo it!
It was a good job and Max Alben knew whom he had to thank for it—his
 great-grandfather.


 "Good old Giovanni Albeni," he muttered as he hurried into the
 laboratory slightly ahead of the escorting technicians, all of them,
 despite the excitement of the moment, remembering to bob their heads
 deferentially at the half-dozen full-fleshed and hard-faced men
 lolling on the couches that had been set up around the time machine.


 He shrugged rapidly out of his rags, as he had been instructed in the
 anteroom, and stepped into the housing of the enormous mechanism.
 This was the first time he had seen it, since he had been taught
 how to operate it on a dummy model, and now he stared at the great
 transparent coils and the susurrating energy bubble with much respect.


 This machine, the pride and the hope of 2089, was something almost
 outside his powers of comprehension. But Max Alben knew how to run it,
 and he knew, roughly, what it was supposed to accomplish. He knew also
 that this was the first backward journey of any great duration and,
 being scientifically unpredictable, might well be the death of him.

C: He resented his family and didn’t care about risking his life
D: He thought he would die on the return trip by blacking out anyways

Passage:
THE GIRL IN HIS MIND
By ROBERT F. YOUNG


 [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from

 Worlds of Tomorrow April 1963

 Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that

 the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]
Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of
 love and lust

Question:
How much time has passed between Blake's night with Eldoria and his search for Sabrina York in his mind-world?

Options:
A: 7 years
B: 10 hours
C: 12 years
D: 1 hour

Correct Answer: B

Changing the world is simple; the trick is
 
to do it before you have a chance to undo it!
It was a good job and Max Alben knew whom he had to thank for it—his
 great-grandfather.


 "Good old Giovanni Albeni," he muttered as he hurried into the
 laboratory slightly ahead of the escorting technicians, all of them,
 despite the excitement of the moment, remembering to bob their heads
 deferentially at the half-dozen full-fleshed and hard-faced men
 lolling on the couches that had been set up around the time machine.


 He shrugged rapidly out of his rags, as he had been instructed in the
 anteroom, and stepped into the housing of the enormous mechanism.
 This was the first time he had seen it, since he had been taught
 how to operate it on a dummy model, and now he stared at the great
 transparent coils and the susurrating energy bubble with much respect.


 This machine, the pride and the hope of 2089, was something almost
 outside his powers of comprehension. But Max Alben knew how to run it,
 and he knew, roughly, what it was supposed to accomplish. He knew also
 that this was the first backward journey of any great duration and,
 being scientifically unpredictable, might well be the death of him.

Question:
What is the relationship like between Sadha and Alben?

Options:
A: Sadha and Alben are both capable of time travel and this time Alben was chosen for the mission which Sadha resented
B: Sadha takes orders from Alben under the direction of another council
C: Sadha was part of designing and building the time machine with Alben
D: Sadha provides orders to Alben, and is under the direction of other men who council him, but their relationship goes no further

Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.

Changing the world is simple; the trick is
 
to do it before you have a chance to undo it!
It was a good job and Max Alben knew whom he had to thank for it—his
 great-grandfather.


 "Good old Giovanni Albeni," he muttered as he hurried into the
 laboratory slightly ahead of the escorting technicians, all of them,
 despite the excitement of the moment, remembering to bob their heads
 deferentially at the half-dozen full-fleshed and hard-faced men
 lolling on the couches that had been set up around the time machine.


 He shrugged rapidly out of his rags, as he had been instructed in the
 anteroom, and stepped into the housing of the enormous mechanism.
 This was the first time he had seen it, since he had been taught
 how to operate it on a dummy model, and now he stared at the great
 transparent coils and the susurrating energy bubble with much respect.


 This machine, the pride and the hope of 2089, was something almost
 outside his powers of comprehension. But Max Alben knew how to run it,
 and he knew, roughly, what it was supposed to accomplish. He knew also
 that this was the first backward journey of any great duration and,
 being scientifically unpredictable, might well be the death of him.

Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated

 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of

the entire ship and crew were as good as dead!
If there is anything I am afraid of, and there probably is, it is
 having a rookie Accident Prone, half-starved from the unemployment
 lines, aboard my spaceship. They are always so anxious to please. They
 remember what it is like to live in a rathole behind an apartment
 house furnace eating day-old bread and wilted vegetables, which doesn't
 compare favorably to the Admiralty-style staterooms and steak and
 caviar they draw down in the Exploration Service.


 You may wonder why anybody should make things so pleasant for a grownup
 who can't walk a city block without tripping over his own feet and who
 has a very low life expectancy on Earth due to the automobiles they are
 constantly stepping in front of and the live wires they are fond of
 picking up so the street won't be littered.


 The Admiralty, however, is a very thorough group of men. Before they
 open a planet to colonization or even fraternization, they insist on
 knowing just what they are up against.


 Accident Prones can find out what is wrong with a planet as easily
 as falling off a log, which they will if there is one lonel

Question:

A: Twice
B: Once

THE GIRL IN HIS MIND
By ROBERT F. YOUNG


 [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from

 Worlds of Tomorrow April 1963

 Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that

 the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]
Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of
 love and lust

Question:

A: 7 years
B: 10 hours

If there is anything I am afraid of, and there probably is, it is

THE GIRL IN HIS MIND

Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of
 love and lust

Question:
Why does shame flame in Blake's cheeks when Deirdre goes to prepare Eldoria's dias?

Options:
A: He is embarrassed at the thought that Deirdre might enter the room while he is sleeping with Eldoria. 
B: He feels that prostitution is morally reprehensible. 
C: He feels guilty about sleeping with Eldoria when there's a child in the hut, Deirdre, who knows exactly what's going on. 
D: He feels guilty about wishing Deirdre was older so he could sleep with her instead. 

Correct Answer: C

Every man's mind is a universe with countless

the entire ship and crew were as good as dead!
If there is anything I am afraid of, and there probably is, it is
 having a rookie Accident Prone, half-starved from the unemployment

 remember what it is like to live in a rathole behind an apartment

 The Admiralty, however, is a very thorough group of men. Before they
 open a planet to colonization or even fraternization, they insist on

 Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that

 the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]
Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of
 love and lust

Passage:
THE GIRL IN HIS MIND
By ROBERT F. YOUNG


 [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from

 Worlds of Tomorrow April 1963

 Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that

 the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]
Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of
 love and lust

Question:
How much time has passed between Blake's night with Eldoria and his search for Sabrina York in his mind-world?

Options:
A: 7 years
B: 10 hours
C: 12 years
D: 1 hour

Question:
Why does Deirdre get so upset when Blake Past suggests she go to prom with the young man?

Options:
A: Because Blake is trying to guilt Deirdre into going with the young man by telling her that it'll ease her conscience. 
B: Because Deirdre has fallen in love with Blake, despite his age, and wants him to take her to the prom.  
C: Because Blake is acting like he's her father, which is a sensitive topic for Deirdre because she lost her real parents. 
D: Because the young man gave up his right arm in order to afford tickets to the prom, and this disgusts Deirdre.

Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated

 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the

 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."

Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of
 love and lust

with one man doing every bit of scoring!
Arthur Lanceford slapped futilely at the sith buzzing hungrily around
 his head. The outsized eight-legged parody of a mosquito did a neat
 half roll and zoomed out of range, hanging motionless on vibrating
 wings a few feet away.
A raindrop staggered it momentarily, and for a fleeting second,
 Lanceford had the insane hope that the arthropod would fall out of
 control into the mud. If it did, that would be the end of it, for
 Niobian mud was as sticky as flypaper. But the sith righted itself
 inches short of disaster, buzzed angrily and retreated to the shelter
 of a nearby broadleaf, where it executed another half roll and hung
 upside down, watching its intended meal with avid anticipation.


 Lanceford eyed the insect distastefully as he explored his jacket for
 repellent and applied the smelly stuff liberally to his face and neck.
 It wouldn't do much good. In an hour, his sweat would remove whatever
 the rain missed—but for that time, it should discourage the sith. As

What was the narrator’s assessment of the life on Niobe compared to the humans of Earth?

C: They were simple and unlikely to survive for long
D: They had a form different than humans that was extremely well adapted to their environment

Bullet With His Name

 [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from

 Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that

Before passing judgment, just ask yourself
 
one question: Would you like answering for
 
humanity any better than Ernie Meeker did?
The Invisible Being shifted his anchorage a bit in Earth's
 gravitational field, which felt like a push rather than a pull to him,
 and said, "This featherless biped seems to satisfy Galaxy Center's
 requirements. I'd say he's a suitable recipient for the Gifts."


 His Coadjutor, equally invisible and negatively massed, chewed that
 over. "Mature by his length and mass. Artificial plumage neither
 overly gaudy nor utterly drab—indicating median social level,
 which is confirmed by the size of his bachelor nest. Inward maps of
 his environment not fantastically inaccurate. Feelings reasonably
 meshed—at least neither volcanic nor frozen. Thoughts and values in
 reasonable order. Yes, I agree, a satisfactory test subject. Except...."


 "Except what?"


 "Except we can never be sure of that 'reasonable' part."


 "Of course not! Thank your stars
that's
beyond the reach of Galaxy
 Center's keenest telepathy, or even ours on the spot. Otherwise you and
 I'd be out of a job."


 "And have to scheme up some other excuse for free-touring the Cosmos
 with backtracking permitted."


 "Exactly!" T

Question:
Where do the presents appear to go when Meeker is finished with them?

THE GIRL IN HIS MIND
By ROBERT F. YOUNG


 [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from

Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of
 love and lust

Passage:
Bullet With His Name
By FRITZ LEIBER


 Illustrated By: DILLON


 [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from

 Galaxy Science Fiction July 1958.

 Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that

 the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]
Before passing judgment, just ask yourself
 
one question: Would you like answering for
 
humanity any better than Ernie Meeker did?
The Invisible Being shifted his anchorage a bit in Earth's
 gravitational field, which felt like a push rather than a pull to him,
 and said, "This featherless biped seems to satisfy Galaxy Center's
 requirements. I'd say he's a suitable recipient for the Gifts."


 His Coadjutor, equally invisible and negatively massed, chewed that
 over. "Mature by his length and mass. Artificial plumage neither
 overly gaudy nor utterly drab—indicating median social level,
 which is confirmed by the size of his bachelor nest. Inward maps of
 his environment not fantastically inaccurate. Feelings reasonably
 meshed—at least neither volcanic nor frozen. Thoughts and values in
 reasonable order. Yes, I agree, a satisfactory test subject. Except...."


 "Except what?"


 "Except we can never be sure of that 'reasonable' part."


 "Of course not! Thank your stars
that's
beyond the reach of Galaxy
 Center's keenest telepathy, or even ours on the spot. Otherwise you and
 I'd be out of a job."


 "And have to scheme up some other excuse for free-touring the Cosmos
 with backtracking permitted."


 "Exactly!" T

Question:
How does Meeker receive presents in the story?

Options:
A: They come addressed to him on the curb which he has to hide from his neighbors
B: They all seem to appear like regular everyday objects or experiences at first
C: They are tucked into his pockets
D: They materialize in a green flame that only he can see

By ROBERT F. YOUNG


 [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from

Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of
 love and lust

 [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from

 Galaxy Science Fiction July 1958.

 Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that

Before passing judgment, just ask yourself
 
one question: Would you like answering for
 
humanity any better than Ernie Meeker did?
The Invisible Being shifted his anchorage a bit in Earth's
 gravitational field, which felt like a push rather than a pull to him,
 and said, "This featherless biped seems to satisfy Galaxy Center's
 requirements. I'd say he's a suitable recipient for the Gifts."


 His Coadjutor, equally invisible and negatively massed, chewed that
 over. "Mature by his length and mass. Artificial plumage neither
 overly gaudy nor utterly drab—indicating median social level,
 which is confirmed by the size of his bachelor nest. Inward maps of
 his environment not fantastically inaccurate. Feelings reasonably
 meshed—at least neither volcanic nor frozen. Thoughts and values in
 reasonable order. Yes, I agree, a satisfactory test subject. Except...."


 "Except what?"


 "Except we can never be sure of that 'reasonable' part."


 "Of course not! Thank your stars
that's
beyond the reach of Galaxy
 Center's keenest telepathy, or even ours on the spot. Otherwise you and
 I'd be out of a job."


 "And have to scheme up some other excuse for free-touring the Cosmos
 with backtracking permitted."


 "Exactly!" T

Passage:
THE GIRL IN HIS MIND
By ROBERT F. YOUNG


 [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from

 Worlds of Tomorrow April 1963

 Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that

 the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]
Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of
 love and lust

Question:
How much time has passed between Blake's night with Eldoria and his search for Sabrina York in his mind-world?

Options:
A: 7 years
B: 10 hours
C: 12 years

Passage:
Bullet With His Name
By FRITZ LEIBER


 Illustrated By: DILLON


 [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from

 Galaxy Science Fiction July 1958.

 Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that

 the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]
Before passing judgment, just ask yourself
 
one question: Would you like answering for
 
humanity any better than Ernie Meeker did?
The Invisible Being shifted his anchorage a bit in Earth's
 gravitational field, which felt like a push rather than a pull to him,
 and said, "This featherless biped seems to satisfy Galaxy Center's
 requirements. I'd say he's a suitable recipient for the Gifts."


 His Coadjutor, equally invisible and negatively massed, chewed that
 over. "Mature by his length and mass. Artificial plumage neither
 overly gaudy nor utterly drab—indicating median social level,
 which is confirmed by the size of his bachelor nest. Inward maps of
 his environment not fantastically inaccurate. Feelings reasonably
 meshed—at least neither volcanic nor frozen. Thoughts and values in
 reasonable order. Yes, I agree, a satisfactory test subject. Except...."


 "Except what?"


 "Except we can never be sure of that 'reasonable' part."


 "Of course not! Thank your stars
that's
beyond the reach of Galaxy
 Center's keenest telepathy, or even ours on the spot. Otherwise you and
 I'd be out of a job."


 "And have to scheme up some other excuse for free-touring the Cosmos
 with backtracking permitted."


 "Exactly!" T

Question:
What is Meeker’s outlook on life through the story?

Options:
A: He feels cursed and afraid
B: He thinks things are starting to look up for him overall
C: He doesn’t think he has the kind of life worth living
D: He finds joy in the simple things and is confident in himself

Passage:
THE GIRL IN HIS MIND
By ROBERT F. YOUNG


 [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from

 Worlds of Tomorrow April 1963

 Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that

 the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]
Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of
 love and lust

Question:
How much time has passed between Blake's night with Eldoria and his search for Sabrina York in his mind-world?

Options:
A: 7 years
B: 10 hours
C: 12 years
D: 1 hour

C: Because Blake is acting like he's her father, which is a sensitive topic for Deirdre because she lost her real parents.

Passage:
Bullet With His Name
By FRITZ LEIBER


 Illustrated By: DILLON


 [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from

 Galaxy Science Fiction July 1958.

 Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that

 the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]
Before passing judgment, just ask yourself
 
one question: Would you like answering for
 
humanity any better than Ernie Meeker did?
The Invisible Being shifted his anchorage a bit in Earth's
 gravitational field, which felt like a push rather than a pull to him,
 and said, "This featherless biped seems to satisfy Galaxy Center's
 requirements. I'd say he's a suitable recipient for the Gifts."


 His Coadjutor, equally invisible and negatively massed, chewed that
 over. "Mature by his length and mass. Artificial plumage neither
 overly gaudy nor utterly drab—indicating median social level,
 which is confirmed by the size of his bachelor nest. Inward maps of
 his environment not fantastically inaccurate. Feelings reasonably
 meshed—at least neither volcanic nor frozen. Thoughts and values in
 reasonable order. Yes, I agree, a satisfactory test subject. Except...."


 "Except what?"


 "Except we can never be sure of that 'reasonable' part."


 "Of course not! Thank your stars
that's
beyond the reach of Galaxy
 Center's keenest telepathy, or even ours on the spot. Otherwise you and
 I'd be out of a job."


 "And have to scheme up some other excuse for free-touring the Cosmos
 with backtracking permitted."


 "Exactly!" T

Question:
What is the relationship like between Ernie and his family?

Options:
A: His sister and uncle are close with him, and they all spend time together on the holidays
B: They seem to tolerate each other well enough, though there is perhaps some suspicion
C: Ernie feels like an outcast in his family and seeks familial-like bonds elsewhere
D: His mother is fully supportive of all his wishes, though his Uncle is very suspicious of him

Bullet With His Name

 [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from

 Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that

Before passing judgment, just ask yourself
 
one question: Would you like answering for
 
humanity any better than Ernie Meeker did?
The Invisible Being shifted his anchorage a bit in Earth's
 gravitational field, which felt like a push rather than a pull to him,
 and said, "This featherless biped seems to satisfy Galaxy Center's
 requirements. I'd say he's a suitable recipient for the Gifts."


 His Coadjutor, equally invisible and negatively massed, chewed that
 over. "Mature by his length and mass. Artificial plumage neither
 overly gaudy nor utterly drab—indicating median social level,
 which is confirmed by the size of his bachelor nest. Inward maps of
 his environment not fantastically inaccurate. Feelings reasonably
 meshed—at least neither volcanic nor frozen. Thoughts and values in
 reasonable order. Yes, I agree, a satisfactory test subject. Except...."


 "Except what?"


 "Except we can never be sure of that 'reasonable' part."


 "Of course not! Thank your stars
that's
beyond the reach of Galaxy
 Center's keenest telepathy, or even ours on the spot. Otherwise you and
 I'd be out of a job."


 "And have to scheme up some other excuse for free-touring the Cosmos
 with backtracking permitted."


 "Exactly!" T

Question:
Who on Earth was given the presents?

Options:
A: One person from each country, though the presents were not the same
B: One person from each family in Chicago
C: At least two people that were then deemed to be crazy by the rest of the public
D: Only Ernie Meeker

Passage:
THE GIRL IN HIS MIND
By ROBERT F. YOUNG


 [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from

 Worlds of Tomorrow April 1963

 Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that

 the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]
Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of
 love and lust

Question:
How much time has passed between Blake's night with Eldoria and his search for Sabrina York in his mind-world?

A: 7 years
B: 10 hours

 [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from

 Galaxy Science Fiction July 1958.

 Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that

Before passing judgment, just ask yourself
 
one question: Would you like answering for
 
humanity any better than Ernie Meeker did?
The Invisible Being shifted his anchorage a bit in Earth's
 gravitational field, which felt like a push rather than a pull to him,
 and said, "This featherless biped seems to satisfy Galaxy Center's
 requirements. I'd say he's a suitable recipient for the Gifts."


 His Coadjutor, equally invisible and negatively massed, chewed that
 over. "Mature by his length and mass. Artificial plumage neither
 overly gaudy nor utterly drab—indicating median social level,
 which is confirmed by the size of his bachelor nest. Inward maps of
 his environment not fantastically inaccurate. Feelings reasonably
 meshed—at least neither volcanic nor frozen. Thoughts and values in
 reasonable order. Yes, I agree, a satisfactory test subject. Except...."


 "Except what?"


 "Except we can never be sure of that 'reasonable' part."


 "Of course not! Thank your stars
that's
beyond the reach of Galaxy
 Center's keenest telepathy, or even ours on the spot. Otherwise you and
 I'd be out of a job."


 "And have to scheme up some other excuse for free-touring the Cosmos
 with backtracking permitted."


 "Exactly!" T

Question:
What were the presents Meeker received from largest to smallest?

Options:

THE GIRL IN HIS MIND
By ROBERT F. YOUNG


 [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from

 Worlds of Tomorrow April 1963

 Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that

 the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]
Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of
 love and lust

Question:

Bullet With His Name
By FRITZ LEIBER


 Illustrated By: DILLON


 [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from

 Galaxy Science Fiction July 1958.

 Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that

 the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]
Before passing judgment, just ask yourself
 
one question: Would you like answering for
 
humanity any better than Ernie Meeker did?
The Invisible Being shifted his anchorage a bit in Earth's
 gravitational field, which felt like a push rather than a pull to him,
 and said, "This featherless biped seems to satisfy Galaxy Center's
 requirements. I'd say he's a suitable recipient for the Gifts."


 His Coadjutor, equally invisible and negatively massed, chewed that
 over. "Mature by his length and mass. Artificial plumage neither
 overly gaudy nor utterly drab—indicating median social level,
 which is confirmed by the size of his bachelor nest. Inward maps of
 his environment not fantastically inaccurate. Feelings reasonably
 meshed—at least neither volcanic nor frozen. Thoughts and values in
 reasonable order. Yes, I agree, a satisfactory test subject. Except...."


 "Except what?"


 "Except we can never be sure of that 'reasonable' part."


 "Of course not! Thank your stars
that's
beyond the reach of Galaxy
 Center's keenest telepathy, or even ours on the spot. Otherwise you and
 I'd be out of a job."


 "And have to scheme up some other excuse for free-touring the Cosmos
 with backtracking permitted."


 "Exactly!" T

Passage:
THE GIRL IN HIS MIND
By ROBERT F. YOUNG


 [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from

 Worlds of Tomorrow April 1963

 Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that

 the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]
Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of
 love and lust

Question:
How much time has passed between Blake's night with Eldoria and his search for Sabrina York in his mind-world?

Options:
A: 7 years
B: 10 hours
C: 12 years

Passage:
Bullet With His Name
By FRITZ LEIBER


 Illustrated By: DILLON


 [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from

 Galaxy Science Fiction July 1958.

 Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that

 the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]
Before passing judgment, just ask yourself
 
one question: Would you like answering for
 
humanity any better than Ernie Meeker did?
The Invisible Being shifted his anchorage a bit in Earth's
 gravitational field, which felt like a push rather than a pull to him,
 and said, "This featherless biped seems to satisfy Galaxy Center's
 requirements. I'd say he's a suitable recipient for the Gifts."


 His Coadjutor, equally invisible and negatively massed, chewed that
 over. "Mature by his length and mass. Artificial plumage neither
 overly gaudy nor utterly drab—indicating median social level,
 which is confirmed by the size of his bachelor nest. Inward maps of
 his environment not fantastically inaccurate. Feelings reasonably
 meshed—at least neither volcanic nor frozen. Thoughts and values in
 reasonable order. Yes, I agree, a satisfactory test subject. Except...."


 "Except what?"


 "Except we can never be sure of that 'reasonable' part."


 "Of course not! Thank your stars
that's
beyond the reach of Galaxy
 Center's keenest telepathy, or even ours on the spot. Otherwise you and
 I'd be out of a job."


 "And have to scheme up some other excuse for free-touring the Cosmos
 with backtracking permitted."


 "Exactly!" T

Question:
What did Meeker do with his first present?

Options:
A: Gave it away to his uncle
B: Threw it away
C: Let his coworkers borrow it to see if it was only him that noticed it’s specialties
D: Studied it carefully and hatched plans to replicate it

Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of

Passage:
THE GIRL IN HIS MIND
By ROBERT F. YOUNG


 [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from

 Worlds of Tomorrow April 1963

 Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that

 the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]
Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of
 love and lust

Question:
How much time has passed between Blake's night with Eldoria and his search for Sabrina York in his mind-world?

Options:
A: 7 years
B: 10 hours
C: 12 years
D: 1 hour

Question:
Why does Deirdre get so upset when Blake Past suggests she go to prom with the young man?

Options:
A: Because Blake is trying to guilt Deirdre into going with the young man by telling her that it'll ease her conscience. 
B: Because Deirdre has fallen in love with Blake, despite his age, and wants him to take her to the prom.  
C: Because Blake is acting like he's her father, which is a sensitive topic for Deirdre because she lost her real parents. 
D: Because the young man gave up his right arm in order to afford tickets to the prom, and this disgusts Deirdre.

Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of
 love and lust

Every man's mind is a universe with countless

The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated

THE GIRL IN HIS MIND
By ROBERT F. YOUNG

Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of
 love and lust

Question:
How much time has passed between Blake's night with Eldoria and his search for Sabrina York in his mind-world?

A: 7 years
B: 10 hours

Question:
Why does Deirdre get so upset when Blake Past suggests she go to prom with the young man?

Options:
A: Because Blake is trying to guilt Deirdre into going with the young man by telling her that it'll ease her conscience. 
B: Because Deirdre has fallen in love with Blake, despite his age, and wants him to take her to the prom.  
C: Because Blake is acting like he's her father, which is a sensitive topic for Deirdre because she lost her real parents. 
D: Because the young man gave up his right arm in order to afford tickets to the prom, and this disgusts Deirdre.

I've always said that even if Sis is seven years older than me—and a
 girl besides—she don't always know what's best. Put me on a spaceship
 jam-packed with three hundred females just aching to get themselves
 husbands in the one place they're still to be had—the planet
 Venus—and you know I'll be in trouble.


 Bad trouble. With the law, which is the worst a boy can get into.


 Twenty minutes after we lifted from the Sahara Spaceport, I wriggled
 out of my acceleration hammock and started for the door of our cabin.

 I tore down the corridor. Most of the cabins had purple lights on in

Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted

 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of
 love and lust

Question:
Why does Deirdre get so upset when Blake Past suggests she go to prom with the young man?

Options:
A: Because Blake is trying to guilt Deirdre into going with the young man by telling her that it'll ease her conscience. 
B: Because Deirdre has fallen in love with Blake, despite his age, and wants him to take her to the prom.  
C: Because Blake is acting like he's her father, which is a sensitive topic for Deirdre because she lost her real parents. 
D: Because the young man gave up his right arm in order to afford tickets to the prom, and this disgusts Deirdre.

Actually, there wouldn't be too much difference if women took

 over the Earth altogether. But not for some men and most boys!
I've always said that even if Sis is seven years older than me—and a
 girl besides—she don't always know what's best. Put me on a spaceship
 jam-packed with three hundred females just aching to get themselves
 husbands in the one place they're still to be had—the planet
 Venus—and you know I'll be in trouble.


 Bad trouble. With the law, which is the worst a boy can get into.


 Twenty minutes after we lifted from the Sahara Spaceport, I wriggled
 out of my acceleration hammock and started for the door of our cabin.


 "Now you be careful, Ferdinand," Sis called after me as she opened a
 book called
Family Problems of the Frontier Woman
. "Remember you're
 a nice boy. Don't make me ashamed of you."


 I tore down the corridor. Most of the cabins had purple lights on in
 front of the doors, showing that the girls were still inside their
 hammocks. That meant only the ship's crew was up and about. Ship's
 crews are men; women are too busy with important things like government
 to run ships. I felt free all over—and happy. Now was my chance to

Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of
 love and lust

Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of
 love and lust

Question:

Actually, there wouldn't be too much difference if women took

 over the Earth altogether. But not for some men and most boys!
I've always said that even if Sis is seven years older than me—and a
 girl besides—she don't always know what's best. Put me on a spaceship
 jam-packed with three hundred females just aching to get themselves
 husbands in the one place they're still to be had—the planet
 Venus—and you know I'll be in trouble.


 Bad trouble. With the law, which is the worst a boy can get into.


 Twenty minutes after we lifted from the Sahara Spaceport, I wriggled
 out of my acceleration hammock and started for the door of our cabin.


 "Now you be careful, Ferdinand," Sis called after me as she opened a
 book called
Family Problems of the Frontier Woman
. "Remember you're
 a nice boy. Don't make me ashamed of you."


 I tore down the corridor. Most of the cabins had purple lights on in
 front of the doors, showing that the girls were still inside their

Passage:
THE GIRL IN HIS MIND
By ROBERT F. YOUNG


 [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from

 Worlds of Tomorrow April 1963

 Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that

 the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]
Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of
 love and lust

Question:
How much time has passed between Blake's night with Eldoria and his search for Sabrina York in his mind-world?

Options:
A: 7 years
B: 10 hours
C: 12 years
D: 1 hour

Actually, there wouldn't be too much difference if women took

 over the Earth altogether. But not for some men and most boys!
I've always said that even if Sis is seven years older than me—and a
 girl besides—she don't always know what's best. Put me on a spaceship
 jam-packed with three hundred females just aching to get themselves
 husbands in the one place they're still to be had—the planet
 Venus—and you know I'll be in trouble.


 Bad trouble. With the law, which is the worst a boy can get into.


 Twenty minutes after we lifted from the Sahara Spaceport, I wriggled
 out of my acceleration hammock and started for the door of our cabin.


 "Now you be careful, Ferdinand," Sis called after me as she opened a
 book called
Family Problems of the Frontier Woman
. "Remember you're
 a nice boy. Don't make me ashamed of you."


 I tore down the corridor. Most of the cabins had purple lights on in
 front of the doors, showing that the girls were still inside their
 hammocks. That meant only the ship's crew was up and about. Ship's

 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of
 love and lust

Options:
A: He is embarrassed at the thought that Deirdre might enter the room while he is sleeping with Eldoria. 
B: He feels that prostitution is morally reprehensible. 
C: He feels guilty about sleeping with Eldoria when there's a child in the hut, Deirdre, who knows exactly what's going on. 
D: He feels guilty about wishing Deirdre was older so he could sleep with her instead. 

Correct Answer: C

THE GIRL IN HIS MIND
By ROBERT F. YOUNG

 Worlds of Tomorrow April 1963

 Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that

 the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]
Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."

Passage:
THE GIRL IN HIS MIND
By ROBERT F. YOUNG


 [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from

 Worlds of Tomorrow April 1963

 Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that

 the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]
Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of
 love and lust

THE GIRL IN HIS MIND

Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of
 love and lust

Question:
Why does Deirdre get so upset when Blake Past suggests she go to prom with the young man?

Options:
A: Because Blake is trying to guilt Deirdre into going with the young man by telling her that it'll ease her conscience. 
B: Because Deirdre has fallen in love with Blake, despite his age, and wants him to take her to the prom.  
C: Because Blake is acting like he's her father, which is a sensitive topic for Deirdre because she lost her real parents. 
D: Because the young man gave up his right arm in order to afford tickets to the prom, and this disgusts Deirdre.

Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7

 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of

Passage:
THE GIRL IN HIS MIND
By ROBERT F. YOUNG


 [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from

 Worlds of Tomorrow April 1963

 Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that

 the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]
Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of
 love and lust

Question:
How much time has passed between Blake's night with Eldoria and his search for Sabrina York in his mind-world?

Options:
A: 7 years
B: 10 hours
C: 12 years
D: 1 hour

The Ignoble Savages

 Illustrated by DILLON


 [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from

Snaddra had but one choice in its fight
 
to afford to live belowground—underhandedly
 
pretend theirs was an aboveboard society!
"Go Away from me, Skkiru," Larhgan said, pushing his hand off her arm.
 "A beggar does not associate with the high priestess of Snaddra."


 "But the Earthmen aren't due for another fifteen minutes," Skkiru
 protested.


 "Of what importance are fifteen minutes compared to eternity!" she
 exclaimed. Her lovely eyes fuzzed softly with emotion. "You don't seem
 to realize, Skkiru, that this isn't just a matter of minutes or hours.
 It's forever."
"Forever!" He looked at her incredulously. "You mean we're going to
 keep this up as a permanent thing? You're joking!"


 Bbulas groaned, but Skkiru didn't care about that. The sad, sweet way
 Larhgan shook her beautiful head disturbed him much more, and when
 she said, "No, Skkiru, I am not joking," a tiny pang of doubt and
 apprehension began to quiver in his second smallest left toe.


 "This is, in effect, good-by," she continued. "We shall see each other
 again, of course, but only from a distance. On feast days, perhaps you
 may be permitted to kiss the hem of my robe ... but that will be all."


 Skkiru turned to the third person present in 

Question:
What measures did the Snaddra creatures take for the arrival of the Earth visitors?

Options:
A: Creating great rain on the surface to appear as a primitive mud-based architectural beings, dressing in jeweled robes to show their opulence
B: Destroying their underground cities, returning to the existing surface huts, acting from Earth’s culture so as to be accepted by them
C: Hiding their spaceships, speaking in Earth’s language, constructing primitive accommodations
D: Pretending to live on the surface, constructing primitive accommodations, acting as though they had no influences from Earth’s culture

Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of
 love and lust

Question:
Why does shame flame in Blake's cheeks when Deirdre goes to prepare Eldoria's dias?

Options:
A: He is embarrassed at the thought that Deirdre might enter the room while he is sleeping with Eldoria. 
B: He feels that prostitution is morally reprehensible. 
C: He feels guilty about sleeping with Eldoria when there's a child in the hut, Deirdre, who knows exactly what's going on. 
D: He feels guilty about wishing Deirdre was older so he could sleep with her instead. 

Correct Answer: C

Snaddra had but one choice in its fight
 
to afford to live belowground—underhandedly
 
pretend theirs was an aboveboard society!
"Go Away from me, Skkiru," Larhgan said, pushing his hand off her arm.
 "A beggar does not associate with the high priestess of Snaddra."


 "But the Earthmen aren't due for another fifteen minutes," Skkiru
 protested.


 "Of what importance are fifteen minutes compared to eternity!" she
 exclaimed. Her lovely eyes fuzzed softly with emotion. "You don't seem
 to realize, Skkiru, that this isn't just a matter of minutes or hours.
 It's forever."
"Forever!" He looked at her incredulously. "You mean we're going to
 keep this up as a permanent thing? You're joking!"


 Bbulas groaned, but Skkiru didn't care about that. The sad, sweet way
 Larhgan shook her beautiful head disturbed him much more, and when
 she said, "No, Skkiru, I am not joking," a tiny pang of doubt and
 apprehension began to quiver in his second smallest left toe.


 "This is, in effect, good-by," she continued. "We shall see each other
 again, of course, but only from a distance. On feast days, perhaps you
 may be permitted to kiss the hem of my robe ... but that will be all."


 Skkiru turned to the third person present in 

Question:
What did Skkiru come to think about his beggar role?

Options:
A: He would be able to collect riches like chocolate as a beggar and that it might not actually be as horrible as he originally thought
B: It was orchestrated by Larhgan to break off their engagement
C: It was a highly valued role since he could act as a spy
D: It was a unsustainable fallacy since no one on the planet would actually support him, though he may be able to achieve his goals in the end

Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7

 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."

Snaddra had but one choice in its fight
 
to afford to live belowground—underhandedly
 
pretend theirs was an aboveboard society!
"Go Away from me, Skkiru," Larhgan said, pushing his hand off her arm.
 "A beggar does not associate with the high priestess of Snaddra."


 "But the Earthmen aren't due for another fifteen minutes," Skkiru
 protested.


 "Of what importance are fifteen minutes compared to eternity!" she
 exclaimed. Her lovely eyes fuzzed softly with emotion. "You don't seem
 to realize, Skkiru, that this isn't just a matter of minutes or hours.
 It's forever."
"Forever!" He looked at her incredulously. "You mean we're going to
 keep this up as a permanent thing? You're joking!"


 Bbulas groaned, but Skkiru didn't care about that. The sad, sweet way
 Larhgan shook her beautiful head disturbed him much more, and when
 she said, "No, Skkiru, I am not joking," a tiny pang of doubt and
 apprehension began to quiver in his second smallest left toe.


 "This is, in effect, good-by," she continued. "We shall see each other
 again, of course, but only from a distance. On feast days, perhaps you
 may be permitted to kiss the hem of my robe ... but that will be all."


 Skkiru turned to the third person present in 

Question:
How did Skkiru treat the role of beggar in the presence of the Terran visitors?

Options:
A: He thought he was above the role, acting as a high priest instead
B: He was unsure of how to act as a beggar and refrained from engaging with the Terrans
C: He played it convincingly and truthfully
D: He undermined the role and gave away the plan

"Go Away from me, Skkiru," Larhgan said, pushing his hand off her arm.
 "A beggar does not associate with the high priestess of Snaddra."


 "But the Earthmen aren't due for another fifteen minutes," Skkiru

Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of
 love and lust

The Ignoble Savages
By EVELYN E. SMITH


 Illustrated by DILLON


 [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from

 Galaxy Science Fiction March 1957.

Snaddra had but one choice in its fight
 
to afford to live belowground—underhandedly
 
pretend theirs was an aboveboard society!
"Go Away from me, Skkiru," Larhgan said, pushing his hand off her arm.
 "A beggar does not associate with the high priestess of Snaddra."


 "But the Earthmen aren't due for another fifteen minutes," Skkiru
 protested.


 "Of what importance are fifteen minutes compared to eternity!" she
 exclaimed. Her lovely eyes fuzzed softly with emotion. "You don't seem
 to realize, Skkiru, that this isn't just a matter of minutes or hours.
 It's forever."
"Forever!" He looked at her incredulously. "You mean we're going to
 keep this up as a permanent thing? You're joking!"


 Bbulas groaned, but Skkiru didn't care about that. The sad, sweet way
 Larhgan shook her beautiful head disturbed him much more, and when
 she said, "No, Skkiru, I am not joking," a tiny pang of doubt and
 apprehension began to quiver in his second smallest left toe.


 "This is, in effect, good-by," she continued. "We shall see each other
 again, of course, but only from a distance. On feast days, perhaps you
 may be permitted to kiss the hem of my robe ... but that will be all."


 Skkiru turned to the third person present in 

Question:
How is Earth entangled with Skkiru’s planet?

Options:
A: His planet has been developing in the ways of Earth, but is now trying to appear primitive
B: Earth evaluates planets across the galaxy for their resources, and his planet is of particular interest
C: Earth appears to be informing a cultural shift as their technologies reach his planet
D: Earth provided technologies to his planet early on and is checking back in on the status of their progress

Passage:
THE GIRL IN HIS MIND
By ROBERT F. YOUNG


 [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from

 Worlds of Tomorrow April 1963

 Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that

 the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]
Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of
 love and lust

Question:
How much time has passed between Blake's night with Eldoria and his search for Sabrina York in his mind-world?

Options:
A: 7 years
B: 10 hours
C: 12 years
D: 1 hour

The Ignoble Savages

 Illustrated by DILLON


 [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from

Snaddra had but one choice in its fight
 
to afford to live belowground—underhandedly
 
pretend theirs was an aboveboard society!
"Go Away from me, Skkiru," Larhgan said, pushing his hand off her arm.
 "A beggar does not associate with the high priestess of Snaddra."


 "But the Earthmen aren't due for another fifteen minutes," Skkiru
 protested.


 "Of what importance are fifteen minutes compared to eternity!" she
 exclaimed. Her lovely eyes fuzzed softly with emotion. "You don't seem
 to realize, Skkiru, that this isn't just a matter of minutes or hours.
 It's forever."
"Forever!" He looked at her incredulously. "You mean we're going to
 keep this up as a permanent thing? You're joking!"


 Bbulas groaned, but Skkiru didn't care about that. The sad, sweet way
 Larhgan shook her beautiful head disturbed him much more, and when
 she said, "No, Skkiru, I am not joking," a tiny pang of doubt and
 apprehension began to quiver in his second smallest left toe.


 "This is, in effect, good-by," she continued. "We shall see each other
 again, of course, but only from a distance. On feast days, perhaps you
 may be permitted to kiss the hem of my robe ... but that will be all."


 Skkiru turned to the third person present in 

Question:
How are the governing decisions made on the planet?

Options:
A: There is a branch of Earth’s government that oversees all decisions
B: There is a planetary disagreement about decision-making
C: They appear to be made by the will of someone greater than the characters in the story
D: The decisions are made by high officials, in this case the control was given to Bbulas

Passage:
THE GIRL IN HIS MIND
By ROBERT F. YOUNG


 [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from

 Worlds of Tomorrow April 1963

 Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that

 the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]
Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of
 love and lust

Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of
 love and lust

Question:
Why does Deirdre get so upset when Blake Past suggests she go to prom with the young man?

Options:
A: Because Blake is trying to guilt Deirdre into going with the young man by telling her that it'll ease her conscience. 
B: Because Deirdre has fallen in love with Blake, despite his age, and wants him to take her to the prom.  
C: Because Blake is acting like he's her father, which is a sensitive topic for Deirdre because she lost her real parents. 
D: Because the young man gave up his right arm in order to afford tickets to the prom, and this disgusts Deirdre.

Snaddra had but one choice in its fight
 
to afford to live belowground—underhandedly
 
pretend theirs was an aboveboard society!
"Go Away from me, Skkiru," Larhgan said, pushing his hand off her arm.
 "A beggar does not associate with the high priestess of Snaddra."


 "But the Earthmen aren't due for another fifteen minutes," Skkiru
 protested.


 "Of what importance are fifteen minutes compared to eternity!" she
 exclaimed. Her lovely eyes fuzzed softly with emotion. "You don't seem
 to realize, Skkiru, that this isn't just a matter of minutes or hours.
 It's forever."
"Forever!" He looked at her incredulously. "You mean we're going to
 keep this up as a permanent thing? You're joking!"


 Bbulas groaned, but Skkiru didn't care about that. The sad, sweet way
 Larhgan shook her beautiful head disturbed him much more, and when
 she said, "No, Skkiru, I am not joking," a tiny pang of doubt and
 apprehension began to quiver in his second smallest left toe.


 "This is, in effect, good-by," she continued. "We shall see each other
 again, of course, but only from a distance. On feast days, perhaps you
 may be permitted to kiss the hem of my robe ... but that will be all."


 Skkiru turned to the third person present in 

Question:
What is Larhgan’s relationship like with Skkiru and Bbulas?

Options:
A: Skkiru and Bbulas are both trying to gain access to her fortune, but Skkiru is the only one with her true love
B: She resents them both for entangling her in this plan
C: She was previously involved with Skkiru, but the new way of their world required her to now be with Bbulas
D: She would like to be married to Bbulas, but does not know how to communicate this to Skkiru

Snaddra had but one choice in its fight
 
to afford to live belowground—underhandedly

"Go Away from me, Skkiru," Larhgan said, pushing his hand off her arm.
 "A beggar does not associate with the high priestess of Snaddra."


 "But the Earthmen aren't due for another fifteen minutes," Skkiru
 protested.


 "Of what importance are fifteen minutes compared to eternity!" she
 exclaimed. Her lovely eyes fuzzed softly with emotion. "You don't seem

 It's forever."
"Forever!" He looked at her incredulously. "You mean we're going to

 Bbulas groaned, but Skkiru didn't care about that. The sad, sweet way
 Larhgan shook her beautiful head disturbed him much more, and when
 she said, "No, Skkiru, I am not joking," a tiny pang of doubt and
 apprehension began to quiver in his second smallest left toe.

### REAL QUESTION — ANSWER THIS ONLY ###
Passage:
Vulgar Keynesians 

         Economics, like all intellectual enterprises, is subject to the law of diminishing disciples. A great innovator is entitled to some poetic license. If his ideas are at first somewhat rough, if he exaggerates the discontinuity between his vision and what came before, no matter: Polish and perspective can come in due course. But inevitably there are those who follow the letter of the innovator's ideas but misunderstand their spirit, who are more dogmatic in their radicalism than the orthodox were in their orthodoxy. And as ideas spread, they become increasingly simplistic--until what eventually becomes part of the public consciousness, part of what "everyone knows," is no more than a crude caricature of the original. 

         Such has been the fate of Keynesian economics. John Maynard Keynes himself was a magnificently subtle and innovative thinker. Yet one of his unfortunate if unintentional legacies was a style of thought--call it vulgar Keynesianism--that confuses and befogs economic debate to this day. 

         Before the 1936 publication of Keynes' The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money , economists had developed a rich and insightful theory of microeconomics , of the behavior of individual markets and the allocation of resources among them. But macroeconomics --the study of economy-wide events like inflation and deflation, booms and slumps--was in a state of arrested development that left it utterly incapable of making sense

Question:
What is the author’s thesis?

Options:
A: That even Keynesian economists are misinterpreting some of the intentions of Keynes’ original theories
B: There are so many unknowns in Keynes’ theories that it has come time to develop a new set of economic theories separate from his
C: Keynesian economists are more united than divided
D: It’s not possible to know what Keynes’ true intentions were

### REAL QUESTION — ANSWER THIS ONLY ###
Passage:
Vulgar Keynesians 

         Economics, like all intellectual enterprises, is subject to the law of diminishing disciples. A great innovator is entitled to some poetic license. If his ideas are at first somewhat rough, if he exaggerates the discontinuity between his vision and what came before, no matter: Polish and perspective can come in due course. But inevitably there are those who follow the letter of the innovator's ideas but misunderstand their spirit, who are more dogmatic in their radicalism than the orthodox were in their orthodoxy. And as ideas spread, they become increasingly simplistic--until what eventually becomes part of the public consciousness, part of what "everyone knows," is no more than a crude caricature of the original. 

         Such has been the fate of Keynesian economics. John Maynard Keynes himself was a magnificently subtle and innovative thinker. Yet one of his unfortunate if unintentional legacies was a style of thought--call it vulgar Keynesianism--that confuses and befogs economic debate to this day. 

         Before the 1936 publication of Keynes' The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money , economists had developed a rich and insightful theory of microeconomics , of the behavior of individual markets and the allocation of resources among them. But macroeconomics --the study of economy-wide events like inflation and deflation, booms and slumps--was in a state of arrested development that left it utterly incapable of making sense

Question:
What is the fallacy that the author presents?

Options:
A: There are several untrue versions of Keynes’ theories that were circulated early on in his career
B: There are too many people in control of the interest rate to know who makes the decisions
C: Setting the employment capacity for the economy in dangerous
D: The Federal Reserve having complete say on the interest rate cannot coexist with the idea that savings rates increasing is bad for the economy

THE GIRL IN HIS MIND
By ROBERT F. YOUNG

 Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that

 the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]
Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of
 love and lust

### REAL QUESTION — ANSWER THIS ONLY ###
Passage:
Vulgar Keynesians 

         Economics, like all intellectual enterprises, is subject to the law of diminishing disciples. A great innovator is entitled to some poetic license. If his ideas are at first somewhat rough, if he exaggerates the discontinuity between his vision and what came before, no matter: Polish and perspective can come in due course. But inevitably there are those who follow the letter of the innovator's ideas but misunderstand their spirit, who are more dogmatic in their radicalism than the orthodox were in their orthodoxy. And as ideas spread, they become increasingly simplistic--until what eventually becomes part of the public consciousness, part of what "everyone knows," is no more than a crude caricature of the original. 

         Such has been the fate of Keynesian economics. John Maynard Keynes himself was a magnificently subtle and innovative thinker. Yet one of his unfortunate if unintentional legacies was a style of thought--call it vulgar Keynesianism--that confuses and befogs economic debate to this day. 

         Before the 1936 publication of Keynes' The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money , economists had developed a rich and insightful theory of microeconomics , of the behavior of individual markets and the allocation of resources among them. But macroeconomics --the study of economy-wide events like inflation and deflation, booms and slumps--was in a state of arrested development that left it utterly incapable of making sense

Question:
What does the author think is not possible to ensure?

Options:
A: More unemployed people will be linked with greater savings
B: Less savings due to low interest rates will translate to more investments
C: Investments will always increase in the long run
D: Keynes’ theories are still relevant to the economy today

Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of
 love and lust

### REAL QUESTION — ANSWER THIS ONLY ###
Passage:
Vulgar Keynesians 

         Economics, like all intellectual enterprises, is subject to the law of diminishing disciples. A great innovator is entitled to some poetic license. If his ideas are at first somewhat rough, if he exaggerates the discontinuity between his vision and what came before, no matter: Polish and perspective can come in due course. But inevitably there are those who follow the letter of the innovator's ideas but misunderstand their spirit, who are more dogmatic in their radicalism than the orthodox were in their orthodoxy. And as ideas spread, they become increasingly simplistic--until what eventually becomes part of the public consciousness, part of what "everyone knows," is no more than a crude caricature of the original. 

         Such has been the fate of Keynesian economics. John Maynard Keynes himself was a magnificently subtle and innovative thinker. Yet one of his unfortunate if unintentional legacies was a style of thought--call it vulgar Keynesianism--that confuses and befogs economic debate to this day. 

         Before the 1936 publication of Keynes' The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money , economists had developed a rich and insightful theory of microeconomics , of the behavior of individual markets and the allocation of resources among them. But macroeconomics --the study of economy-wide events like inflation and deflation, booms and slumps--was in a state of arrested development that left it utterly incapable of making sense

Question:
What does the author argue is newly developing in relation to Keynesianism?

Options:
A: There is a sense of Keynes’ theories being overstated 
B: Kaynes is being left out of current economic teachings
C: It’s been misinterpreted as only a way to explain unemployment and nothing more
D: It’s being boiled down to the idea that low consumer spend rates cause problems to occur in the economy

THE GIRL IN HIS MIND
By ROBERT F. YOUNG


 [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from

 Worlds of Tomorrow April 1963

 Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that

Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of
 love and lust

Question:
How much time has passed between Blake's night with Eldoria and his search for Sabrina York in his mind-world?

Passage:
Vulgar Keynesians 

         Economics, like all intellectual enterprises, is subject to the law of diminishing disciples. A great innovator is entitled to some poetic license. If his ideas are at first somewhat rough, if he exaggerates the discontinuity between his vision and what came before, no matter: Polish and perspective can come in due course. But inevitably there are those who follow the letter of the innovator's ideas but misunderstand their spirit, who are more dogmatic in their radicalism than the orthodox were in their orthodoxy. And as ideas spread, they become increasingly simplistic--until what eventually becomes part of the public consciousness, part of what "everyone knows," is no more than a crude caricature of the original. 

         Such has been the fate of Keynesian economics. John Maynard Keynes himself was a magnificently subtle and innovative thinker. Yet one of his unfortunate if unintentional legacies was a style of thought--call it vulgar Keynesianism--that confuses and befogs economic debate to this day. 

         Before the 1936 publication of Keynes' The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money , economists had developed a rich and insightful theory of microeconomics , of the behavior of individual markets and the allocation of resources among them. But macroeconomics --the study of economy-wide events like inflation and deflation, booms and slumps--was in a state of arrested development that left it utterly incapable of making sense

### REAL QUESTION — ANSWER THIS ONLY ###
Passage:
Vulgar Keynesians 

         Economics, like all intellectual enterprises, is subject to the law of diminishing disciples. A great innovator is entitled to some poetic license. If his ideas are at first somewhat rough, if he exaggerates the discontinuity between his vision and what came before, no matter: Polish and perspective can come in due course. But inevitably there are those who follow the letter of the innovator's ideas but misunderstand their spirit, who are more dogmatic in their radicalism than the orthodox were in their orthodoxy. And as ideas spread, they become increasingly simplistic--until what eventually becomes part of the public consciousness, part of what "everyone knows," is no more than a crude caricature of the original. 

         Such has been the fate of Keynesian economics. John Maynard Keynes himself was a magnificently subtle and innovative thinker. Yet one of his unfortunate if unintentional legacies was a style of thought--call it vulgar Keynesianism--that confuses and befogs economic debate to this day. 

         Before the 1936 publication of Keynes' The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money , economists had developed a rich and insightful theory of microeconomics , of the behavior of individual markets and the allocation of resources among them. But macroeconomics --the study of economy-wide events like inflation and deflation, booms and slumps--was in a state of arrested development that left it utterly incapable of making sense

Question:
What did Keynes posit was an influence on the rate of interest in the economy?

Options:
A: Desire to hold cash unless incentivized otherwise
B: Full employment
C: Balance between savings and investment
D: Number of crashes per decade

Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the

C: Because Blake is acting like he's her father, which is a sensitive topic for Deirdre because she lost her real parents.

### REAL QUESTION — ANSWER THIS ONLY ###
Passage:
Vulgar Keynesians 

         Economics, like all intellectual enterprises, is subject to the law of diminishing disciples. A great innovator is entitled to some poetic license. If his ideas are at first somewhat rough, if he exaggerates the discontinuity between his vision and what came before, no matter: Polish and perspective can come in due course. But inevitably there are those who follow the letter of the innovator's ideas but misunderstand their spirit, who are more dogmatic in their radicalism than the orthodox were in their orthodoxy. And as ideas spread, they become increasingly simplistic--until what eventually becomes part of the public consciousness, part of what "everyone knows," is no more than a crude caricature of the original. 

         Such has been the fate of Keynesian economics. John Maynard Keynes himself was a magnificently subtle and innovative thinker. Yet one of his unfortunate if unintentional legacies was a style of thought--call it vulgar Keynesianism--that confuses and befogs economic debate to this day. 

         Before the 1936 publication of Keynes' The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money , economists had developed a rich and insightful theory of microeconomics , of the behavior of individual markets and the allocation of resources among them. But macroeconomics --the study of economy-wide events like inflation and deflation, booms and slumps--was in a state of arrested development that left it utterly incapable of making sense

Question:
How does the author use the word vulgar in the piece? To mean:

Options:
A: An accident
B: Danger
C: A partisan understanding
D: A distorted view

Entertainingly, the European Union is perhaps the sole bureaucracy left in the world that admits that its goal is to expand.

The national infrastructure is fraying, with little renewal: Belgians have a high per-capita income and spend it generously on cars and dining, but what Rousseau called the esprit social seems lacking.

### REAL QUESTION — ANSWER THIS ONLY ###
Passage:
I Have Seen the Future of Europe 

         The Eurocrats were thinking ahead when they made Brussels the "Capital of Europe," headquarters of the emerging European Union. Though practically unknown in the United States, the union is one of Europe's biggest stories, an important organization trying to establish itself as a sort of metagovernment for European states. Entertainingly, the European Union is perhaps the sole bureaucracy left in the world that admits that its goal is to expand. And what better place to locate this new enterprise than Brussels, which may be a living preview of the Europe to come: swathed in red tape and pomp, paralyzed by constituency politics, declining at great cost. The European Union couldn't have picked a better home. 

         Belgian politics enjoy none of the rowdy intellectual contention of the United Kingdom, none of the nuance-loving literary polemics of France, not even a strong national identity. The primary issue in public debate is who gets what benefits, and while commerce and money are gods, neither is served particularly well. The national infrastructure is fraying, with little renewal: Belgians have a high per-capita income and spend it generously on cars and dining, but what Rousseau called the esprit social seems lacking. Crumbling, generic, enervated, debt-ridden, materialistic ... is this Europe's future? 

         Brussels is a place where you can take your dog into a restaurant, but not your kids. Where a best-selling prod

THE GIRL IN HIS MIND
By ROBERT F. YOUNG


 [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from

 Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that

 the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]
Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of
 love and lust

THE GIRL IN HIS MIND
By ROBERT F. YOUNG

 Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that

 the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]
Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of
 love and lust

Passage:
I Have Seen the Future of Europe 

         The Eurocrats were thinking ahead when they made Brussels the "Capital of Europe," headquarters of the emerging European Union. Though practically unknown in the United States, the union is one of Europe's biggest stories, an important organization trying to establish itself as a sort of metagovernment for European states. Entertainingly, the European Union is perhaps the sole bureaucracy left in the world that admits that its goal is to expand. And what better place to locate this new enterprise than Brussels, which may be a living preview of the Europe to come: swathed in red tape and pomp, paralyzed by constituency politics, declining at great cost. The European Union couldn't have picked a better home. 

         Belgian politics enjoy none of the rowdy intellectual contention of the United Kingdom, none of the nuance-loving literary polemics of France, not even a strong national identity. The primary issue in public debate is who gets what benefits, and while commerce and money are gods, neither is served particularly well. The national infrastructure is fraying, with little renewal: Belgians have a high per-capita income and spend it generously on cars and dining, but what Rousseau called the esprit social seems lacking. Crumbling, generic, enervated, debt-ridden, materialistic ... is this Europe's future? 

         Brussels is a place where you can take your dog into a restaurant, but not your kids. Where a best-selling prod

Question:
What is the significance of architecture to the arguments?

Options:
A: The author believes the EU is taking over Belgium’s historical buildings with new architectural projects

C: The author thinks that how money is being spent on government buildings is a waste
D: The author is an architect themselves and notice many examples to make their case through the story

Passage:
THE GIRL IN HIS MIND
By ROBERT F. YOUNG


 [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from

 Worlds of Tomorrow April 1963

 Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that

 the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]
Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of
 love and lust

Question:
How much time has passed between Blake's night with Eldoria and his search for Sabrina York in his mind-world?

Options:
A: 7 years
B: 10 hours
C: 12 years
D: 1 hour

Why does Deirdre get so upset when Blake Past suggests she go to prom with the young man?

A: Because Blake is trying to guilt Deirdre into going with the young man by telling her that it'll ease her conscience. 
B: Because Deirdre has fallen in love with Blake, despite his age, and wants him to take her to the prom.  
C: Because Blake is acting like he's her father, which is a sensitive topic for Deirdre because she lost her real parents.

### REAL QUESTION — ANSWER THIS ONLY ###
Passage:
I Have Seen the Future of Europe 

         The Eurocrats were thinking ahead when they made Brussels the "Capital of Europe," headquarters of the emerging European Union. Though practically unknown in the United States, the union is one of Europe's biggest stories, an important organization trying to establish itself as a sort of metagovernment for European states. Entertainingly, the European Union is perhaps the sole bureaucracy left in the world that admits that its goal is to expand. And what better place to locate this new enterprise than Brussels, which may be a living preview of the Europe to come: swathed in red tape and pomp, paralyzed by constituency politics, declining at great cost. The European Union couldn't have picked a better home. 

         Belgian politics enjoy none of the rowdy intellectual contention of the United Kingdom, none of the nuance-loving literary polemics of France, not even a strong national identity. The primary issue in public debate is who gets what benefits, and while commerce and money are gods, neither is served particularly well. The national infrastructure is fraying, with little renewal: Belgians have a high per-capita income and spend it generously on cars and dining, but what Rousseau called the esprit social seems lacking. Crumbling, generic, enervated, debt-ridden, materialistic ... is this Europe's future? 

         Brussels is a place where you can take your dog into a restaurant, but not your kids. Where a best-selling prod

Question:
What are some of the positive aspects the author highlights?

Options:
A: There are no blatant positives discussed
B: The streamlining of nations under the European Union
C: The move to have one currency across Europe
D: The apparent good will of the people staffing the headquarter building

Passage:
I Have Seen the Future of Europe 

         The Eurocrats were thinking ahead when they made Brussels the "Capital of Europe," headquarters of the emerging European Union. Though practically unknown in the United States, the union is one of Europe's biggest stories, an important organization trying to establish itself as a sort of metagovernment for European states. Entertainingly, the European Union is perhaps the sole bureaucracy left in the world that admits that its goal is to expand. And what better place to locate this new enterprise than Brussels, which may be a living preview of the Europe to come: swathed in red tape and pomp, paralyzed by constituency politics, declining at great cost. The European Union couldn't have picked a better home. 

         Belgian politics enjoy none of the rowdy intellectual contention of the United Kingdom, none of the nuance-loving literary polemics of France, not even a strong national identity. The primary issue in public debate is who gets what benefits, and while commerce and money are gods, neither is served particularly well. The national infrastructure is fraying, with little renewal: Belgians have a high per-capita income and spend it generously on cars and dining, but what Rousseau called the esprit social seems lacking. Crumbling, generic, enervated, debt-ridden, materialistic ... is this Europe's future?

Passage:
I Have Seen the Future of Europe 

         The Eurocrats were thinking ahead when they made Brussels the "Capital of Europe," headquarters of the emerging European Union. Though practically unknown in the United States, the union is one of Europe's biggest stories, an important organization trying to establish itself as a sort of metagovernment for European states. Entertainingly, the European Union is perhaps the sole bureaucracy left in the world that admits that its goal is to expand. And what better place to locate this new enterprise than Brussels, which may be a living preview of the Europe to come: swathed in red tape and pomp, paralyzed by constituency politics, declining at great cost. The European Union couldn't have picked a better home. 

         Belgian politics enjoy none of the rowdy intellectual contention of the United Kingdom, none of the nuance-loving literary polemics of France, not even a strong national identity. The primary issue in public debate is who gets what benefits, and while commerce and money are gods, neither is served particularly well. The national infrastructure is fraying, with little renewal: Belgians have a high per-capita income and spend it generously on cars and dining, but what Rousseau called the esprit social seems lacking. Crumbling, generic, enervated, debt-ridden, materialistic ... is this Europe's future?

Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7

The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated

 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted

### REAL QUESTION — ANSWER THIS ONLY ###
Passage:
I Have Seen the Future of Europe 

         The Eurocrats were thinking ahead when they made Brussels the "Capital of Europe," headquarters of the emerging European Union. Though practically unknown in the United States, the union is one of Europe's biggest stories, an important organization trying to establish itself as a sort of metagovernment for European states. Entertainingly, the European Union is perhaps the sole bureaucracy left in the world that admits that its goal is to expand. And what better place to locate this new enterprise than Brussels, which may be a living preview of the Europe to come: swathed in red tape and pomp, paralyzed by constituency politics, declining at great cost. The European Union couldn't have picked a better home. 

         Belgian politics enjoy none of the rowdy intellectual contention of the United Kingdom, none of the nuance-loving literary polemics of France, not even a strong national identity. The primary issue in public debate is who gets what benefits, and while commerce and money are gods, neither is served particularly well. The national infrastructure is fraying, with little renewal: Belgians have a high per-capita income and spend it generously on cars and dining, but what Rousseau called the esprit social seems lacking. Crumbling, generic, enervated, debt-ridden, materialistic ... is this Europe's future? 

         Brussels is a place where you can take your dog into a restaurant, but not your kids. Where a best-selling prod

Question:
How does the author’s tone shift over the course of the story?

C: They start out hopeful and are slowly dismayed  with further findings
D: Desolate to begin with, shifting to the glimmers of promising results to come

Passage:
MONICA!
The White House may have been in crisis all year, but the events were less the stuff of great drama than of a farcical musical comedy. Hey, wait a minute--let's put on a show! 

                         The time: November 1995.              

                         The House Republicans, led by Speaker Newt Gingrich, are insisting on their version of the budget. President Bill Clinton is stubbornly rejecting it. The Republicans have taken a bold option: They will just refuse to pass a budget, and they'll let the government shut down. In the Oval Office, BILL CLINTON meets with advisers LEON PANETTA and HAROLD ICKES and secretary BETTY CURRIE to discuss this development.              

         "The Shutdown" (upbeat production number) 

                         PANETTA: The Republicans have positions 

         To which they're clinging fast. 

                         ICKES: The president is just as firm

                         PANETTA: The Army and the Navy 

         Will need to stay in place.

Passage:
MONICA!
The White House may have been in crisis all year, but the events were less the stuff of great drama than of a farcical musical comedy. Hey, wait a minute--let's put on a show! 

                         The time: November 1995.              

                         The House Republicans, led by Speaker Newt Gingrich, are insisting on their version of the budget. President Bill Clinton is stubbornly rejecting it. The Republicans have taken a bold option: They will just refuse to pass a budget, and they'll let the government shut down. In the Oval Office, BILL CLINTON meets with advisers LEON PANETTA and HAROLD ICKES and secretary BETTY CURRIE to discuss this development.

                         PANETTA: The Republicans have positions 

         To which they're clinging fast.

                         CLINTON 

            [speaking]                : Well, wait a second--not all of them. We'll need to keep some essential personnel. 

                         PANETTA: The Army and the Navy 

         Will need to stay in place. 

                         ICKES: Also those at NASA 

         Who keep the shuttle up in s

Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of
 love and lust

B: 10 hours

                         The House Republicans, led by Speaker Newt Gingrich, are insisting on their version of the budget. President Bill Clinton is stubbornly rejecting it.

Passage:
THE GIRL IN HIS MIND
By ROBERT F. YOUNG


 [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from

 Worlds of Tomorrow April 1963

 Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that

 the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]
Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of
 love and lust

Question:
How much time has passed between Blake's night with Eldoria and his search for Sabrina York in his mind-world?

Options:
A: 7 years
B: 10 hours
C: 12 years
D: 1 hour

Why does Deirdre get so upset when Blake Past suggests she go to prom with the young man?

The White House may have been in crisis all year, but the events were less the stuff of great drama than of a farcical musical comedy. Hey, wait a minute--let's put on a show! 

                         The time: November 1995.              

                         The House Republicans, led by Speaker Newt Gingrich, are insisting on their version of the budget. President Bill Clinton is stubbornly rejecting it. The Republicans have taken a bold option: They will just refuse to pass a budget, and they'll let the government shut down.

         Will be sent home on furloughs. 

                         CLINTON

                         PANETTA: The Army and the Navy 

         Will need to stay in place.

Passage:
THE GIRL IN HIS MIND
By ROBERT F. YOUNG


 [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from

 Worlds of Tomorrow April 1963

 Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that

 the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]
Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of
 love and lust

Question:
How much time has passed between Blake's night with Eldoria and his search for Sabrina York in his mind-world?

Options:
A: 7 years
B: 10 hours
C: 12 years
D: 1 hour

Correct Answer: B

### REAL QUESTION — ANSWER THIS ONLY ###
Passage:
MONICA!
The White House may have been in crisis all year, but the events were less the stuff of great drama than of a farcical musical comedy. Hey, wait a minute--let's put on a show! 

                         The time: November 1995.              

                         The House Republicans, led by Speaker Newt Gingrich, are insisting on their version of the budget. President Bill Clinton is stubbornly rejecting it. The Republicans have taken a bold option: They will just refuse to pass a budget, and they'll let the government shut down. In the Oval Office, BILL CLINTON meets with advisers LEON PANETTA and HAROLD ICKES and secretary BETTY CURRIE to discuss this development.              

         "The Shutdown" (upbeat production number) 

                         PANETTA: The Republicans have positions 

         To which they're clinging fast. 

                         ICKES: The president is just as firm 

         The die, it seems, is cast. 

                         PANETTA: Without a budget passed by Congress 

         The government will close. 

         All of the workers 

         Will be sent home on furloughs. 

                         CLINTON 

            [speaking]                : Well, wait a second--not all of them. We'll need to keep some essential personnel. 

                         PANETTA: The Army and the Navy 

         Will need to stay in place. 

                         ICKES: Also those at NASA 

         Who keep the shuttle up in s

Question:
Why would the president need an intern?

Options:
A: The intern would organize things for the other Oval office staff
B: To save money during a government shut down
C: He never did have an intern
D: It was a cover up to keep the affair going

THE GIRL IN HIS MIND
By ROBERT F. YOUNG


 [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from

 Worlds of Tomorrow April 1963

 Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that

 the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]
Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of
 love and lust

Question:
How much time has passed between Blake's night with Eldoria and his search for Sabrina York in his mind-world?

A: 7 years
B: 10 hours
C: 12 years

The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted

 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was

Passage:
MONICA!
The White House may have been in crisis all year, but the events were less the stuff of great drama than of a farcical musical comedy. Hey, wait a minute--let's put on a show! 

                         The time: November 1995.              

                         The House Republicans, led by Speaker Newt Gingrich, are insisting on their version of the budget. President Bill Clinton is stubbornly rejecting it. The Republicans have taken a bold option: They will just refuse to pass a budget, and they'll let the government shut down. In the Oval Office, BILL CLINTON meets with advisers LEON PANETTA and HAROLD ICKES and secretary BETTY CURRIE to discuss this development.              

         "The Shutdown" (upbeat production number) 

                         PANETTA: The Republicans have positions 

         To which they're clinging fast. 

                         ICKES: The president is just as firm 

         The die, it seems, is cast. 

                         PANETTA: Without a budget passed by Congress 

         The government will close. 

         All of the workers 

         Will be sent home on furloughs. 

                         CLINTON 

            [speaking]                : Well, wait a second--not all of them. We'll need to keep some essential personnel. 

                         PANETTA: The Army and the Navy 

         Will need to stay in place. 

                         ICKES: Also those at NASA 

         Who keep the shuttle up in s

Question:
What happened with the impending government shut down at the opening of the musical number?

Options:
A: The shutdown threat is only mentioned at the start and not again
B: The government shut down entirely
C: The shutdown caused greater interest in the president’s personal life because there was nothing else to focus on
D: The shutdown was avoided with the actions of the President

Passage:
MONICA!
The White House may have been in crisis all year, but the events were less the stuff of great drama than of a farcical musical comedy. Hey, wait a minute--let's put on a show! 

                         The time: November 1995.              

                         The House Republicans, led by Speaker Newt Gingrich, are insisting on their version of the budget. President Bill Clinton is stubbornly rejecting it. The Republicans have taken a bold option: They will just refuse to pass a budget, and they'll let the government shut down. In the Oval Office, BILL CLINTON meets with advisers LEON PANETTA and HAROLD ICKES and secretary BETTY CURRIE to discuss this development.              

         "The Shutdown" (upbeat production number) 

                         PANETTA: The Republicans have positions 

         To which they're clinging fast. 

                         ICKES: The president is just as firm 

         The die, it seems, is cast. 

                         PANETTA: Without a budget passed by Congress 

         The government will close. 

         All of the workers

### REAL QUESTION — ANSWER THIS ONLY ###
Passage:
Reading the Inaugurals 

         President Clinton's Inaugural Address this month is the 53 rd in the series that began in 1789. All are worth a read--not just the highlights, such as George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, and FDR. They will give you a feeling of being there, not as an omniscient historian of 1997 looking back at 1837 or 1897 but as an ordinary citizen who shares--and is limited by--the information, the concerns, and the values of those times. (Thanks to Columbia University, all the addresses can be found on the Web.) 

         Among all the past presidents and their speech writers there was only one literary genius: Lincoln. After 132 years, his second inaugural still brings tears to your eyes and chills your blood. None of the other inaugural addresses are in that league. But by and large they are dignified and intelligent speeches given by articulate men, each in touch with his times and aware that his inauguration was the most solemn occasion of his life. 

         The stance and style of the inaugurals seem to have gone through three phases. The first, lasting until Lincoln, was that of the modest, classic public servant. The second, lasting through William Howard Taft, was of the prosaic government executive. The third, in which we are still, is the phase of the assertive, theatrical leader-preacher. This classification is not waterproof. Theodore Roosevelt may belong in the third phase and Warren G. Harding-Calvin Coolidge-Herbert Hoover in the second.

Question:
Where was the turning point for inaugural speeches no longer revealing humility in the author’s view?

Options:
A: After Wilson
B: After Lincoln
C: After Roosevelt
D: After Washington

### REAL QUESTION — ANSWER THIS ONLY ###
Passage:
Reading the Inaugurals 

         President Clinton's Inaugural Address this month is the 53 rd in the series that began in 1789. All are worth a read--not just the highlights, such as George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, and FDR. They will give you a feeling of being there, not as an omniscient historian of 1997 looking back at 1837 or 1897 but as an ordinary citizen who shares--and is limited by--the information, the concerns, and the values of those times. (Thanks to Columbia University, all the addresses can be found on the Web.) 

         Among all the past presidents and their speech writers there was only one literary genius: Lincoln. After 132 years, his second inaugural still brings tears to your eyes and chills your blood. None of the other inaugural addresses are in that league. But by and large they are dignified and intelligent speeches given by articulate men, each in touch with his times and aware that his inauguration was the most solemn occasion of his life. 

         The stance and style of the inaugurals seem to have gone through three phases. The first, lasting until Lincoln, was that of the modest, classic public servant. The second, lasting through William Howard Taft, was of the prosaic government executive. The third, in which we are still, is the phase of the assertive, theatrical leader-preacher. This classification is not waterproof. Theodore Roosevelt may belong in the third phase and Warren G. Harding-Calvin Coolidge-Herbert Hoover in the second.

Question:
What stages does the author describe the inaugural addresses going through over time?

Options:
A: Modesty, inspirational, executive portrayal
B: Flaunting of executive power, modesty, inspiration
C: Modesty, inspiration
D: Modesty, executive portrayal, inspirational

THE GIRL IN HIS MIND
By ROBERT F. YOUNG


 [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from

 Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that

 the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]
Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."

### REAL QUESTION — ANSWER THIS ONLY ###
Passage:
Reading the Inaugurals 

         President Clinton's Inaugural Address this month is the 53 rd in the series that began in 1789. All are worth a read--not just the highlights, such as George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, and FDR. They will give you a feeling of being there, not as an omniscient historian of 1997 looking back at 1837 or 1897 but as an ordinary citizen who shares--and is limited by--the information, the concerns, and the values of those times. (Thanks to Columbia University, all the addresses can be found on the Web.) 

         Among all the past presidents and their speech writers there was only one literary genius: Lincoln. After 132 years, his second inaugural still brings tears to your eyes and chills your blood. None of the other inaugural addresses are in that league. But by and large they are dignified and intelligent speeches given by articulate men, each in touch with his times and aware that his inauguration was the most solemn occasion of his life. 

         The stance and style of the inaugurals seem to have gone through three phases. The first, lasting until Lincoln, was that of the modest, classic public servant. The second, lasting through William Howard Taft, was of the prosaic government executive. The third, in which we are still, is the phase of the assertive, theatrical leader-preacher. This classification is not waterproof. Theodore Roosevelt may belong in the third phase and Warren G. Harding-Calvin Coolidge-Herbert Hoover in the second.

Question:
Which is a true thesis that the author presents in their piece?

Options:
A: Presidents recycle sentiments from past speeches without crediting the original speaker
B: Presidents do not treat the inaugural speech with enough sincerity
C: Presidents rely on focus groups to direct the content of the speech
D: Presidents have almost never written their own speeches

Passage:
THE GIRL IN HIS MIND
By ROBERT F. YOUNG


 [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from

 Worlds of Tomorrow April 1963

 Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that

 the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]
Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of
 love and lust

Question:
How much time has passed between Blake's night with Eldoria and his search for Sabrina York in his mind-world?

Options:
A: 7 years
B: 10 hours
C: 12 years
D: 1 hour

B: Because Deirdre has fallen in love with Blake, despite his age, and wants him to take her to the prom.  
C: Because Blake is acting like he's her father, which is a sensitive topic for Deirdre because she lost her real parents.

### REAL QUESTION — ANSWER THIS ONLY ###
Passage:
Reading the Inaugurals 

         President Clinton's Inaugural Address this month is the 53 rd in the series that began in 1789. All are worth a read--not just the highlights, such as George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, and FDR. They will give you a feeling of being there, not as an omniscient historian of 1997 looking back at 1837 or 1897 but as an ordinary citizen who shares--and is limited by--the information, the concerns, and the values of those times. (Thanks to Columbia University, all the addresses can be found on the Web.) 

         Among all the past presidents and their speech writers there was only one literary genius: Lincoln. After 132 years, his second inaugural still brings tears to your eyes and chills your blood. None of the other inaugural addresses are in that league. But by and large they are dignified and intelligent speeches given by articulate men, each in touch with his times and aware that his inauguration was the most solemn occasion of his life. 

         The stance and style of the inaugurals seem to have gone through three phases. The first, lasting until Lincoln, was that of the modest, classic public servant. The second, lasting through William Howard Taft, was of the prosaic government executive. The third, in which we are still, is the phase of the assertive, theatrical leader-preacher. This classification is not waterproof. Theodore Roosevelt may belong in the third phase and Warren G. Harding-Calvin Coolidge-Herbert Hoover in the second.

Question:
How is the topic of slavery treated in inaugural speeches?

Options:
A: It is not treated with proper gravity, and referred to only in terms of progress
B: Is was mentioned 17 times in the Roosevelt address
C: It is often referenced in inaugural speeches from the 1850s through the 1960s
D: Its reference depends on the political party in power

This classification is not waterproof. Theodore Roosevelt may belong in the third phase and Warren G. Harding-Calvin Coolidge-Herbert Hoover in the second.

Question:
What is the author’s overall thesis about inaugural speeches?

Options:
A: They are largely useless
B: They present a snapshot of the views and beliefs of their time

### REAL QUESTION — ANSWER THIS ONLY ###
Passage:
Reading the Inaugurals 

         President Clinton's Inaugural Address this month is the 53 rd in the series that began in 1789. All are worth a read--not just the highlights, such as George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, and FDR. They will give you a feeling of being there, not as an omniscient historian of 1997 looking back at 1837 or 1897 but as an ordinary citizen who shares--and is limited by--the information, the concerns, and the values of those times. (Thanks to Columbia University, all the addresses can be found on the Web.) 

         Among all the past presidents and their speech writers there was only one literary genius: Lincoln. After 132 years, his second inaugural still brings tears to your eyes and chills your blood. None of the other inaugural addresses are in that league. But by and large they are dignified and intelligent speeches given by articulate men, each in touch with his times and aware that his inauguration was the most solemn occasion of his life. 

         The stance and style of the inaugurals seem to have gone through three phases. The first, lasting until Lincoln, was that of the modest, classic public servant. The second, lasting through William Howard Taft, was of the prosaic government executive. The third, in which we are still, is the phase of the assertive, theatrical leader-preacher. This classification is not waterproof. Theodore Roosevelt may belong in the third phase and Warren G. Harding-Calvin Coolidge-Herbert Hoover in the second.

Question:
What is the most spoken about topic in inaugural speeches that were analyzed?

Options:
A: Foreign wars
B: Slavery
C: Women's rights
D: Taxes

Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the

 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."

### REAL QUESTION — ANSWER THIS ONLY ###
Passage:
Reading the Inaugurals 

         President Clinton's Inaugural Address this month is the 53 rd in the series that began in 1789. All are worth a read--not just the highlights, such as George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, and FDR. They will give you a feeling of being there, not as an omniscient historian of 1997 looking back at 1837 or 1897 but as an ordinary citizen who shares--and is limited by--the information, the concerns, and the values of those times. (Thanks to Columbia University, all the addresses can be found on the Web.) 

         Among all the past presidents and their speech writers there was only one literary genius: Lincoln. After 132 years, his second inaugural still brings tears to your eyes and chills your blood. None of the other inaugural addresses are in that league. But by and large they are dignified and intelligent speeches given by articulate men, each in touch with his times and aware that his inauguration was the most solemn occasion of his life. 

         The stance and style of the inaugurals seem to have gone through three phases. The first, lasting until Lincoln, was that of the modest, classic public servant. The second, lasting through William Howard Taft, was of the prosaic government executive. The third, in which we are still, is the phase of the assertive, theatrical leader-preacher. This classification is not waterproof. Theodore Roosevelt may belong in the third phase and Warren G. Harding-Calvin Coolidge-Herbert Hoover in the second.

Question:
How do the most recent speeches that were analyzed compare to the earlier speeches?

Options:
A: They are getting longer overall, but with less substance
B: They contain less jargon than prior years
C: They contain shorter sentences and try to unite people
D: They are generally becoming more humble as time goes on

Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the

### REAL QUESTION — ANSWER THIS ONLY ###
Passage:
Reading the Inaugurals 

         President Clinton's Inaugural Address this month is the 53 rd in the series that began in 1789. All are worth a read--not just the highlights, such as George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, and FDR. They will give you a feeling of being there, not as an omniscient historian of 1997 looking back at 1837 or 1897 but as an ordinary citizen who shares--and is limited by--the information, the concerns, and the values of those times. (Thanks to Columbia University, all the addresses can be found on the Web.) 

         Among all the past presidents and their speech writers there was only one literary genius: Lincoln. After 132 years, his second inaugural still brings tears to your eyes and chills your blood. None of the other inaugural addresses are in that league. But by and large they are dignified and intelligent speeches given by articulate men, each in touch with his times and aware that his inauguration was the most solemn occasion of his life. 

         The stance and style of the inaugurals seem to have gone through three phases. The first, lasting until Lincoln, was that of the modest, classic public servant. The second, lasting through William Howard Taft, was of the prosaic government executive. The third, in which we are still, is the phase of the assertive, theatrical leader-preacher. This classification is not waterproof. Theodore Roosevelt may belong in the third phase and Warren G. Harding-Calvin Coolidge-Herbert Hoover in the second.

Question:
What are the elements that the author seems most perplexed by in the inaugural speeches?

Options:
A: The lack of coverage of taxes as a public issue
B: The consistent use of one phrase through all of the inaugural speeches
C: The increasing amount of words per sentence over time
D: The lack of discussion of hot topics by presidents inaugurated during those eras

Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of

Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."


 Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of
 love and lust

Question:
Why does Deirdre get so upset when Blake Past suggests she go to prom with the young man?

Options:
A: Because Blake is trying to guilt Deirdre into going with the young man by telling her that it'll ease her conscience. 
B: Because Deirdre has fallen in love with Blake, despite his age, and wants him to take her to the prom.  
C: Because Blake is acting like he's her father, which is a sensitive topic for Deirdre because she lost her real parents. 
D: Because the young man gave up his right arm in order to afford tickets to the prom, and this disgusts Deirdre.

### REAL QUESTION — ANSWER THIS ONLY ###
Passage:
Reading the Inaugurals 

         President Clinton's Inaugural Address this month is the 53 rd in the series that began in 1789. All are worth a read--not just the highlights, such as George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, and FDR. They will give you a feeling of being there, not as an omniscient historian of 1997 looking back at 1837 or 1897 but as an ordinary citizen who shares--and is limited by--the information, the concerns, and the values of those times. (Thanks to Columbia University, all the addresses can be found on the Web.) 

         Among all the past presidents and their speech writers there was only one literary genius: Lincoln. After 132 years, his second inaugural still brings tears to your eyes and chills your blood. None of the other inaugural addresses are in that league. But by and large they are dignified and intelligent speeches given by articulate men, each in touch with his times and aware that his inauguration was the most solemn occasion of his life. 

         The stance and style of the inaugurals seem to have gone through three phases. The first, lasting until Lincoln, was that of the modest, classic public servant. The second, lasting through William Howard Taft, was of the prosaic government executive. The third, in which we are still, is the phase of the assertive, theatrical leader-preacher. This classification is not waterproof. Theodore Roosevelt may belong in the third phase and Warren G. Harding-Calvin Coolidge-Herbert Hoover in the second.

Question:
What does the author think about inaugural speech writers compared with the delivering presidents?

Options:
A: The writers are considered to be just as important as the delivering president
B: The writers are highly applauded
C: The writers are cast aside as unimportant in the process
D: The subject is not covered

The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated

Every man's mind is a universe with countless

 places in which he can hide—even from himself!
The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated
 version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7
 practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,
 it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted
 the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the
 nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was
 slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the
 shadows at the back of the room. "Is she free?" he asked.


 "I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps."

### REAL QUESTION — ANSWER THIS ONLY ###
Passage:
Folie ࠎ 

         People with high IQs tend to be nearsighted. This is not because they read a lot or stare at computer screens too much. That common-sense hypothesis has been discredited by research. Rather, it is a matter of genetics. The same genes that tend to elevate IQ also tend to affect the shape of the eyeball in a way that leads to myopia. This relationship--known in genetics as "pleiotropy"--seems to be completely accidental, a quirk of evolution. 

         Could there be a similar pleiotropy between madness and mathematics? Reading this absolutely fascinating biography by Sylvia Nasar, an economics writer for the New York Times , I began to wonder. Its subject, John Nash, is a mathematical genius who went crazy at the age of 30 and then, after several decades of flamboyant lunacy, was awarded the Nobel Prize in economics for something he had discovered as a graduate student. (He is now about to turn 70.) Nash is among the latest in a long and distinguished line of mathematicians--stretching back to that morbid paranoiac, Isaac Newton--who have been certifiably insane during parts of their lives. 

         Just in the last 100 years or so, most of the heroic figures in the foundations of mathematics have landed in mental asylums or have died by their own hand. The greatest of them, Kurt Gödel, starved himself to death in the belief that his colleagues were putting poison in his food. Of the two pioneers of game theory--the field in which Nash garnered his Nobel-

Question:

C: Lewd public conduct, nudity, violence, communications with extraterrestrials
D: Communicating with extraterrestrials, creating fake passports, violence
